General: Well-appearing, no distress
Skin: No malar rash, no discoid lesions, no alopecia

Labs (last week):
- CBC: WBC 5.2, Hgb 12.4, Plt 185
- CMP: Cr 1.0 (eGFR 78), normal LFTs
- Urinalysis: Trace protein (stable), no RBCs, no casts
- UPCR: 0.3 (stable - remission)
- C3: 88 (normal), C4: 18 (normal)
- dsDNA: 1:40 (low positive, stable)
- ESR: 18, CRP: 0.4

Ophthalmology note: Annual HCQ screening - no maculopathy, continue.

Assessment/Plan:
1. SLE - STABLE, in remission. SLEDAI-2K: 2 (minimal activity).
   - Continue hydroxychloroquine 400mg (neuroprotective, prevents flares)
   - Continue mycophenolate 1000mg BID for nephritis maintenance
   - Continue low-dose prednisone 5mg - may attempt taper to 2.5mg in 3 months
     if continues stable
   - Complements normal, dsDNA stable

2. Lupus Nephritis Class III - in remission. UPCR 0.3, stable creatinine.
   - Continue current immunosuppression
   - Nephrology co-management

3. CKD Stage 2 - stable eGFR 78. Continue monitoring.

4. Antiphospholipid syndrome - on warfarin, no clotting events since 2016.
   - Continue lifelong anticoagulation
   - Target INR 2.5-3.5 (venous event)

5. HTN - controlled on lisinopril.

6. Bone health - on chronic prednisone. Continue calcium/vitamin D. DEXA due
   this year.

7. Future pregnancy counseling - discussed again. Will need to transition off
   MMF (teratogenic) well before conception, switch to azathioprine. Warfarin
   also teratogenic - will need to transition to heparin.

Continue current regimen. Labs in 2 months. RTC 4 months.
