ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)

"I was diagnosed with lupus at 26. It was a shock - I had no idea what was
happening when I started getting joint pain, rashes, and fatigue. It took over
a year to get diagnosed because lupus can look like so many other things.

The hardest part was when I developed kidney involvement. I had to have a kidney
biopsy and go on stronger medications. That was terrifying - lupus nephritis can
lead to kidney failure. Thankfully, my kidneys have been stable for the past
few years on my current medications.

I also had a blood clot in my leg in 2016, which led to finding out I have
antiphospholipid syndrome - another autoimmune condition that goes with lupus.
Now I'm on blood thinners for life. It's a lot of medications to manage.

The sun is my enemy now. I used to love being outside, going to the beach,
hiking. Now I have to avoid sun or cover up completely. I've learned to adapt
but I miss that freedom.

I want to have children someday. I know it's possible but I'll need to plan
carefully with my doctors. Some of my medications aren't safe during pregnancy
so I'll need to switch and be stable for a while first. It's overwhelming
to think about but I'm hopeful.

The hardest thing is the unpredictability. I can feel fine one week and
flaring the next. I've learned to listen to my body and pace myself. I'm lucky
to have supportive employers who understand when I need flexibility.

Being a social worker in a hospital actually helps - I understand what patients
go through with chronic illness. I feel like my experience makes me better
at my job."
