Vitals: BP 148/94 (elevated), HR 88, Temp 99.8°F, Wt 152 lbs (up 7 lbs)
General: Ill-appearing, fatigued
Skin: Malar rash present (erythematous, raised, sparing nasolabial folds)
      Active alopecia noted - diffuse thinning

Joints: Synovitis bilateral MCPs and wrists, PIPs swollen bilaterally,
        tender with ROM
Lungs: Clear
Cardiac: RRR, no rub
Extremities: 1+ pitting edema bilateral ankles

Labs (STAT today):
- CBC: WBC 3.2 (low), Hgb 10.8 (low), Plt 128 (low)
- CMP: Cr 1.4 (UP from 1.0), BUN 28
- Urinalysis: 2+ protein (was trace), 10-15 RBC/hpf, RBC casts present
- UPCR: 1.8 (UP from 0.3!!!)
- C3: 52 (LOW, was 88), C4: 8 (LOW, was 18)
- dsDNA: 1:320 (UP from 1:40)
- ESR: 68, CRP: 2.4
- INR: 2.8 (therapeutic)

Assessment/Plan:
***SLE FLARE - SEVERE, WITH ACTIVE NEPHRITIS***

1. SLE Flare - SLEDAI-2K now 16 (was 2). Multi-organ involvement:
   - Mucocutaneous: Malar rash, oral ulcers, alopecia
   - Arthritis: Active polyarthritis
   - Hematologic: Leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
   - Renal: Active nephritis (see below)
   - Serology: Consumed complements, rising dsDNA
   - Constitutional: Fever, fatigue

2. LUPUS NEPHRITIS FLARE - Active nephritis with:
   - Rising creatinine (1.0 → 1.4)
   - Proteinuria worsening (UPCR 0.3 → 1.8)
   - Active sediment (RBC casts)
   - Hypertension worsening
   - URGENT nephrology consult placed - likely needs repeat renal biopsy
     to assess class and activity/chronicity
   - Treatment will depend on biopsy but likely needs intensification

3. TREATMENT PLAN:
   - Increase prednisone to 60mg daily (1mg/kg) immediately
   - PCP prophylaxis: Start Bactrim - WAIT, ALLERGY. Use dapsone or atovaquone.
     Start atovaquone 1500mg daily.
   - Continue MMF for now - may need to add rituximab or belimumab after biopsy
   - Check G6PD before dapsone if using
   - BP control: Increase lisinopril to 20mg daily

4. Trigger: Likely UV exposure at outdoor wedding. Reinforced strict sun avoidance.

5. Antiphospholipid syndrome - continue warfarin. INR therapeutic.

6. Lab monitoring:
   - Repeat labs in 1 week
   - 24-hour urine for protein quantification ordered
   - Anti-dsDNA and complements to follow response

7. Bone protection for high-dose steroids:
   - Increase calcium/vitamin D
   - Consider bisphosphonate (check DEXA)
   - Monitor glucose (steroids)

8. Work: Patient needs medical leave. Will provide documentation.

PATIENT COUNSELING:
- Explained this is a significant flare requiring aggressive treatment
- High-dose steroids have side effects but necessary to control inflammation
- May need additional immunosuppression depending on biopsy
- Emphasized importance of sun protection going forward
- Patient understands, anxious but cooperative

Nephrology consult today - Dr. Patel will see patient this afternoon for
biopsy planning.

Close follow-up in 1 week. Call if fever >101, worsening edema, decreased urine
output, chest pain, or neurological symptoms.
