Chief Complaint: Follow-up labs, bariatric surgery eval update

Subjective:
Pt returns for metabolic follow-up. Reports he went to bariatric surgery consultation
and has been approved pending 6-month supervised weight loss program. Started seeing
their dietitian monthly. Has made some diet changes - less fast food, trying to
meal prep. Lost about 5 lbs so far.

Got CPAP mask refit - now using nasal pillows which are more comfortable. Using
CPAP 4-5 nights per week. Feels "a little more rested" but still tired.

No CP, less SOB than before. Still some RUQ discomfort occasionally.

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/84, HR 74, RR 16, Wt 293 lbs (-5 lbs), BMI 43.4, SpO2 95% RA
General: Morbidly obese male, slightly better energy
Abdomen: Obese, non-tender today

Labs from 06/08:
- A1c: 6.5%
- Fasting glucose: 126
- ALT: 58, AST: 45
- TG: 218, HDL: 34, LDL: 138

Assessment/Plan:
1. Obesity - some progress with bariatric program. Encourage continued efforts.
2. NEW: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - A1c now 6.5%, meets diagnostic criteria. Discussed
   with patient. Given bariatric surgery is planned and A1c borderline, will start
   metformin 500mg BID. If surgery successful, may be able to discontinue. DM education
   ordered.
3. HTN - slightly improved. Continue current dose.
4. Hyperlipidemia - still concerning pattern. With new DM diagnosis, statin now more
   strongly indicated. Patient agrees to try atorvastatin 20mg.
5. OSA - improved compliance with new mask. Encourage continued use every night.
6. NAFLD - transaminases stable/improving. Continue weight loss efforts.

Start:
- Metformin 500mg BID
