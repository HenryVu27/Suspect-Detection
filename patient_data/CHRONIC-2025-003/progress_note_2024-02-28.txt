PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Marcus Johnson    DOB: 11/03/1978    MRN: 56789123
Date: 2024-02-28       Provider: Dr. Kevin Park, MD

Chief Complaint: Weight management, metabolic syndrome follow-up

Subjective:
46 yo M here for metabolic syndrome management. Weight has been "creeping up" -
attributes to stress at work (recently promoted to management, more sedentary).
Admits not using CPAP regularly - "mask is uncomfortable, feel claustrophobic."
Uses it maybe 2x/week. Still snoring loudly per wife, daytime fatigue significant.

Diet has been poor - eating out frequently due to work demands, portion control
difficult. Exercise minimal - occasional weekend walks with family.

Denies CP, SOB at rest. Does get winded easily with stairs. No polyuria/polydipsia.
Reports occasional right upper quadrant discomfort after fatty meals.

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily

Previously declined:
- Statin
- Metformin for prediabetes

Objective:
Vitals: BP 142/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 98.6F, Wt 298 lbs (+12 lbs from last year),
       BMI 44.1, SpO2 94% RA, Neck circumference 18.5 inches
General: Morbidly obese male, appears tired, truncal obesity
HEENT: Neck thick, no thyromegaly
CV: RRR, distant heart sounds
Lungs: Clear but diminished at bases
Abdomen: Obese, mild RUQ tenderness, no hepatomegaly palpable
Ext: Trace edema bilateral LE

Labs from 02/20:
- A1c: 6.4% (up from 6.2%)
- Fasting glucose: 118
- ALT: 68 (H), AST: 52 (H)
- TG: 245 (H), HDL: 32 (L), LDL: 142
- Cr: 1.0, eGFR 92

Assessment/Plan:
1. Morbid obesity - BMI 44.1, weight gain despite counseling. Discussed bariatric
   surgery referral again - patient now interested given weight trajectory. Placing
   referral to bariatric program. Continue dietary counseling. Consider GLP-1 agonist.
2. Prediabetes - A1c 6.4%, approaching diabetes threshold. Reconsidered metformin -
   patient still declines, wants to "try harder with diet first." Will give 3 months.
   If A1c >=6.5% at next check, will strongly recommend medication.
3. HTN - not controlled. Increase lisinopril to 20mg daily.
4. Hyperlipidemia - LDL elevated, TG very high, HDL very low. Classic metabolic pattern.
   Again discussed statin - patient concerned about side effects. Will revisit after
   weight loss attempts.
5. OSA - poorly controlled due to CPAP non-adherence. Referred to sleep medicine for
   mask refit and alternatives discussion. Emphasized importance.
6. NAFLD - transaminases remain elevated. Weight loss is primary treatment. If
   bariatric surgery proceeds, liver biopsy likely will be done.

RTC 3 months with labs. Bariatric referral placed.
