Chief Complaint: Bipolar disorder follow-up, mood check

Subjective:
35 yo M with Bipolar I disorder here for routine follow-up. Reports mood has been
"okay but fragile." Some low days over past month - not severe depression but "not
feeling like myself." Sleep has been inconsistent - sometimes sleeping 10-11 hours,
sometimes only 5. Appetite increased.

Denies manic symptoms - no decreased need for sleep, no grandiosity, no impulsive
behaviors, no racing thoughts. No psychotic symptoms.

Work going okay - freelance graphic designer, managing deadlines.

Medication adherence: "Pretty good." Admits missing doses occasionally when traveling
for work. Has not been checking lithium levels regularly - last level was 9 months ago.

No SI/HI.

Current Medications:
- Lithium 600mg BID
- Lamotrigine 200mg daily
- Buspirone 15mg BID
- Levothyroxine 50mcg daily
- Atorvastatin 20mg QHS

Objective:
Vitals: BP 124/82, HR 72, Wt 218 lbs (+4), BMI 32.8
General: Appears tired, psychomotor slowing
Psych: Mood "meh", affect constricted, no pressured speech, thought process linear,
       no SI/HI, no psychotic features

PHQ-9: 11 (moderate depression)
MDQ: Negative for current mania

Assessment/Plan:
1. Bipolar I Disorder - subsyndromal depressive symptoms. PHQ-9: 11. Not meeting
   criteria for major depressive episode but needs monitoring.
   - Continue lithium and lamotrigine - backbone of mood stabilization
   - Labs overdue - check lithium level, TSH, renal function, lipids TODAY
   - Consider lamotrigine increase if depression worsens (protects against
     depression in bipolar)
   - Sleep hygiene reviewed - irregular sleep is destabilizing
2. Hypothyroidism (lithium-induced) - check TSH
3. Weight - continuing to gain. Lithium effect plus sedentary work. Discussed
   exercise and diet. Consider GLP-1 agonist if continues to worsen.
4. Medication adherence - critical for bipolar stability. Discussed importance.
   Suggested pillbox and phone reminders.
5. No mania indicators currently - continue monitoring for mood switches.

Labs drawn. RTC 4 weeks. Call if mood worsens significantly.

================================================================================
ADDENDUM - 03/18/2024

Labs reviewed:
- Lithium level: 0.5 mEq/L (LOW - therapeutic is 0.6-1.2)
- TSH: 5.8 mIU/L (HIGH - suggests hypothyroidism undertreated)
- Cr: 1.1 (stable)
- eGFR: 82
- LDL: 135 (above goal)

Lithium level subtherapeutic - likely contributing to mood instability. Patient
likely missing doses as suspected. Called patient - discussed importance of
consistent dosing. Increase lithium to 900mg AM, 600mg PM (total 1500mg daily).
Also increase levothyroxine to 75mcg daily for elevated TSH.

Recheck lithium level in 1 week.
