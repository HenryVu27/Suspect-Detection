Chief Complaint: Diabetes follow-up

Subjective:
55 yo M returns for DM f/u. Reports doing well with lifestyle changes. Lost 12 lbs
total since diagnosis. Exercising now - walking 30 min 5 days/week, started going
to gym 2x/week. Diet much improved - wife now working from home more and they're
cooking together.

Checking sugars at home - fasting 100-120, post-meal <160. Taking metformin without
GI issues after initial week of loose stools.

Completed diabetes education class. Found it helpful. Saw ophthalmology - "eyes are
fine, no diabetes damage yet." Podiatry appointment scheduled for next month.

No numbness, tingling, vision changes. Mood improved. Less anxious about diagnosis now.
