Date: 2024-09-23       Provider: Dr. Michelle Park, MD (Neurology/Headache)

Chief Complaint: Migraine worsening, new symptoms

Subjective:
Pt returns with concerning escalation. "It's been a terrible few months."

Headache diary: Past 30 days - 22 headache days (up from 12). Severe: 10.
Sumatriptan use: 14 times (OVERUSE - exceeds 9/month limit).

New symptoms per patient:
- Migraines changed character: "Different than before. More pressure-like."
- New: Worse when lying down, waking her from sleep
- New: Brief vision changes - "like camera flashes" in right eye x 2 weeks
- New: Pulsatile tinnitus right ear - "whooshing sound with heartbeat"
- New: Worse with coughing, straining, or bending over

Stressors: Job loss 2 months ago. "Laid off in restructuring." Financial stress.
Stopped seeing therapist - "Can't afford it." Not sleeping well. Started drinking
more wine "to cope."

Stopped oral contraceptives 6 weeks ago - "Couldn't afford prescription."

Denies fever, neck stiffness, worst headache of life, weakness, numbness.

Current Medications:
- Topiramate 100mg BID
- Buspirone 15mg BID
- Sumatriptan 50mg PRN (overusing)
- Melatonin 5mg QHS
- (Stopped: OC, Botox missed due to cost)

Objective:
Vitals: BP 142/88 (elevated), HR 78, Wt 145 lbs (up 7 lbs)
General: Appears anxious, tearful at times
Head/Eyes: Papilledema bilateral on fundoscopic exam (NEW - CRITICAL FINDING)
           Pulsatile quality to right eye vessels noted
Neuro: CN II-XII intact, visual fields full to confrontation, normal strength
       and sensation, negative Brudzinski/Kernig

Assessment/Plan:
***RED FLAG SYMPTOMS - URGENT WORKUP REQUIRED***

1. New headache features with papilledema - MUST RULE OUT SECONDARY CAUSE:
   - Papilledema = increased intracranial pressure
   - Concerning symptoms: Worse lying down, worse with Valsalva, pulsatile
     tinnitus, visual phenomena
   - Differential: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), cerebral venous
     thrombosis (CVT), mass lesion
   - Risk factors present: Recent OC use, weight gain, female
   - ACTION:
     * URGENT MRI brain with contrast AND MRV (venogram) - ordered STAT
     * Called radiology - will be performed TODAY
     * If negative for mass/CVT, will need lumbar puncture with opening pressure
     * Ophthalmology referral for formal visual field testing

2. Medication overuse headache - rebound pattern likely contributing. However,
   secondary cause must be ruled out FIRST before addressing this.

3. Chronic migraine - baseline, but current symptoms suggest new pathology.
   Hold Botox until workup complete.

4. Depression/anxiety - worsening in context of job loss. PHQ-9 today: 15
   (moderately severe). Increase buspirone to 20mg BID. Discussed low-cost
   therapy options, community mental health resources.

5. Social stressors - unemployment, financial strain, uninsured. Social work
   referral placed for assistance programs, medication assistance programs.

6. Alcohol use - increased. Counseled regarding migraine trigger and interaction
   with medications.

CRITICAL COMMUNICATION:
- Explained to patient these symptoms require immediate investigation
- If MRI shows mass or clot, will need hospitalization
- Even if imaging normal, LP needed for opening pressure
- Discussed going to ER if severe headache, vision loss, or neurological symptoms

Patient understands severity. Husband driving her to imaging center now.

Will call patient this evening with imaging results.

MRI brain with contrast and MRV completed. RESULTS:
- No mass lesion
- No cerebral venous thrombosis
- Partially empty sella (consistent with IIH)
- Mild flattening of posterior globes (consistent with IIH)
- Prominent optic nerve sheaths

IMPRESSION: Imaging findings consistent with IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION.

Called patient - discussed findings. Scheduled for lumbar puncture tomorrow
with opening pressure measurement. Likely will need acetazolamide. Discussed
importance of weight loss.
