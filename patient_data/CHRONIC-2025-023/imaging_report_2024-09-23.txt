IMAGING REPORT - MRI BRAIN AND MRV

Patient: Rachel Steinberg    DOB: 11/03/1985    MRN: 89012678
Exam Date: 2024-09-23 16:30
Ordering Provider: Dr. Michelle Park, MD
Reading Radiologist: Dr. Kevin Walsh, MD

================================================================================
EXAMINATION: MRI Brain with and without contrast, MR Venography

CLINICAL INDICATION: New-onset positional headaches, papilledema, pulsatile
tinnitus. Rule out cerebral venous thrombosis, mass lesion.

COMPARISON: MRI brain 2019-08-22 (normal)

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain performed without and
with IV gadolinium contrast. MR venography performed.

================================================================================
FINDINGS:

BRAIN PARENCHYMA:
- No mass lesion
- No acute infarct
- No parenchymal hemorrhage
- No abnormal enhancement
- No white matter lesions
- Ventricles normal in size and configuration

SELLA:
- Partially empty sella with flattening of pituitary gland
- Height of pituitary: 3mm (reduced)
- Consistent with raised intracranial pressure

ORBITS:
- Bilateral flattening of posterior globes (new compared to 2019)
- Prominent perioptic subarachnoid spaces bilaterally
- Mild tortuosity of optic nerves bilaterally
- Findings consistent with raised intracranial pressure

VENTRICLES/CSF SPACES:
- No hydrocephalus
- Mildly prominent CSF spaces

DURAL VENOUS SINUSES (MRV):
- Superior sagittal sinus: Patent, no thrombosis
- Transverse sinuses: Patent bilaterally, no thrombosis
- Sigmoid sinuses: Patent bilaterally
- Internal jugular veins: Patent
- No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis

INCIDENTAL FINDINGS:
- Mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses
- Otherwise unremarkable

================================================================================
IMPRESSION:

1. NO CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS. MRV demonstrates patent dural venous sinuses.

2. NO MASS LESION OR HYDROCEPHALUS.

3. IMAGING FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION (IIH):
   - Partially empty sella
   - Bilateral flattening of posterior globes (new)
   - Prominent perioptic subarachnoid spaces
   - Optic nerve tortuosity

   These findings, in conjunction with papilledema and clinical symptoms,
   are highly suggestive of raised intracranial pressure. Recommend lumbar
   puncture with opening pressure measurement for confirmation.

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDING COMMUNICATION:

Not applicable - findings discussed with ordering provider via routine
communication as no acute intervention required. Recommend LP for diagnosis
confirmation.
