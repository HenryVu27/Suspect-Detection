   but still significantly disabling (MIDAS 42). Room for improvement.
   - Administer Botox 155 units per standard protocol today
   - Continue topiramate 100mg BID
   - CGRP inhibitor discussion: May benefit from adding erenumab (Aimovig) or
     fremanezumab (Ajovy) for additional preventive effect. Discussed. Patient
     wants to "see how next few months go" before adding another medication.
   - Triptan use appropriate (6/month, under limit)

2. Sleep - only 5-6 hours, contributing to migraines. Improve sleep hygiene.
   Discussed importance of 7-8 hours. Consider referral to behavioral sleep
   medicine if not improving.

3. Anxiety - stable. Continue buspirone and therapy.

4. Lifestyle factors - work stress major trigger. Discussed boundaries. Patient
   acknowledges difficulty. "I know I need to slow down."

5. Medication overuse prevention - currently not overusing. Educated to continue
   limiting acute medications.

Botox administered today: 155 units, 31 injection sites per protocol. Tolerated
well. No adverse reactions during observation.

RTC 3 months for next Botox. Sooner if migraines worsen.
