PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Emily Nakamura    DOB: 11/14/1992    MRN: 12345891
Date: 2024-10-28       Provider: Dr. Jennifer Liu, MD

Chief Complaint: Increased asthma symptoms, cough

Subjective:
Pt calls for urgent visit. Reports increased cough and SOB x5 days. Started with
URI symptoms - congestion, sore throat, now resolved. But cough persists - dry,
worse at night. Waking up 2x/night with cough. Using rescue inhaler 4-5x/day.

No fever, no purulent sputum. No sick contacts with COVID.

Moved to new apartment 2 weeks ago. New place has old carpet. Boyfriend brought
his cat to visit this weekend - "I know I'm allergic but thought it would be okay
for just a few hours." Cat left but symptoms continued.

Running has been impossible due to SOB.

Current Medications:
- Flovent HFA 44mcg 2 puffs BID
- Albuterol HFA PRN (using frequently)
- Cetirizine 10mg daily
- Fluticasone nasal spray

Objective:
Vitals: BP 112/72, HR 88, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA
General: Mild respiratory distress, speaking full sentences
HEENT: Mild nasal congestion
Lungs: Diffuse expiratory wheezes bilateral, prolonged expiratory phase
CV: RRR, tachycardic

Peak flow: 350 L/min (personal best 460 - 76% of PB)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Asthma exacerbation, moderate - triggered by URI and allergen exposure (cat).
   Peak flow 76% of personal best.
   - Start prednisone 40mg daily x5 days
   - Increase Flovent to 110mcg 2 puffs BID temporarily (step up)
   - Continue albuterol as needed (every 4-6 hours okay)
   - Cat exposure counseling - even brief exposure can trigger multi-day symptoms
   - New apartment - recommend allergen covers for bedding, consider air purifier,
     discuss carpet cleaning/removal if possible
2. Post-viral bronchospasm likely contributing. Should improve with treatment.
3. ACTION PLAN reviewed: Return or call if not improving in 48-72 hours, or if
   worsening (peak flow <50%, can't speak in sentences, using rescue every 2 hours).

RTC 1 week for reassessment. May need to step up maintenance therapy if not
returning to baseline.
