Chief Complaint: PTSD follow-up, medication management

Subjective:
34 yo F OEF veteran with combat-related PTSD here for routine follow-up. Reports
symptoms "manageable but still there." Nightmares 2-3x/week - better since prazosin
increase. Hypervigilance continues - scans rooms for exits, startles easily.
Avoids crowds, fireworks, certain movies.

Working as EMT - finds it meaningful but sometimes triggering. Has good support
from supervisor who is also a veteran. Using grounding techniques from therapy
when triggered at work.

Mood "okay most days." Some days harder than others. Low energy. Not isolating
as much - goes to VA gym 3x/week, joined women veterans' support group.

Migraines 2-3x/month - managed with sumatriptan. Back pain chronic but stable.

In weekly individual therapy (CPT) - finding it helpful but difficult. "Digging
up old stuff is hard."

No SI/HI. "I have too much to live for."
