ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)

"I just finished a trauma therapy called CPT and it changed my life. I was
skeptical at first - I'd tried therapy before and it didn't help much. But this
was different. My therapist helped me work through the memories and beliefs
I had about what happened in Afghanistan.

I used to have nightmares almost every night and couldn't go to crowded places
without panicking. Now I rarely have nightmares and I can do normal things again.
I still avoid fireworks and certain movies but that's okay - I'm not trying to be
'cured', just functional.

Working as an EMT helps give meaning to what I went through. I can help people
in crisis because I understand what it's like. I got promoted to supervisor
recently which feels good.

The VA has taken good care of me. I know a lot of veterans have bad experiences
but my team has been great. I tell other veterans to give treatment a chance."
