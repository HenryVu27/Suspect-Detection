Chief Complaint: PTSD follow-up, completed CPT

Subjective:
Pt returns for follow-up. Major milestone - completed 12-session CPT protocol last
month! Reports feeling "like a different person." Nightmares rare now - maybe 1x
every 2 weeks. Less hypervigilant. Can go to grocery store without scanning for
threats. Watched a war movie with partner without panic attack.

"I used to think I'd never get better. The therapy was the hardest thing I've ever
done but it worked."

Still avoids July 4th fireworks - "not ready for that yet, and that's okay."

Work going well. Got promoted to shift supervisor. Less triggered at work.

Mood improved - more hopeful, enjoying things again. Exercise continues, support
group continues.

Migraines improved - only 1 last month. Attributing to less stress. Back pain same.

No SI/HI.

Current Medications:
- Sertraline 150mg daily
- Prazosin 5mg QHS
- Topiramate 50mg BID

PCL-5: 28 (significant improvement from 42!)
PHQ-9: 5 (mild - improved from 10)

Assessment/Plan:
1. PTSD - SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT! PCL-5 dropped from 42 to 28 after completing
   CPT. This is a major treatment success. Transition to maintenance therapy
   (monthly). Continue prazosin - effective for residual nightmares.
2. Major Depressive Disorder - improved with PTSD treatment. PHQ-9 5. Consider
   sertraline taper in future if continues stable, but not now.
3. Chronic migraine - improved with stress reduction. Consider topiramate taper
   if continues well.
4. Chronic low back pain - stable.
5. Occupational - promoted, functioning well. Excellent progress.

Outstanding response to evidence-based PTSD treatment. Continue current medications.
Transition to monthly maintenance therapy. RTC 3 months.
