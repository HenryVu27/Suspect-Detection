Pt returns for diabetes management. Reports he has been "trying" with diet and
medications. Home glucose log shows variable readings - fasting 140-200, some
readings over 250 after meals. Admits he doesn't always remember to take his
afternoon metformin dose. "Work is busy, I forget."

Thirst and urination somewhat better than before but still present. Fatigue still
significant. Feet tingling at night continues. Has not yet seen ophthalmology -
"couldn't get time off work."

Reports he cut back on sodas and tries to eat smaller portions. Still eating
lunch from food trucks most days. Wife is cooking with less fat.

No hypoglycemia symptoms. Denies chest pain, SOB.

Assessment/Plan:
1. Type 2 Diabetes - not at goal. A1c worsened to 7.8% despite medication.
   - Medication adherence is issue - missing afternoon doses
   - CHANGE to Metformin ER 2000mg once daily (single dose for compliance)
   - ADD Jardiance 10mg daily - will help with glucose and weight
   - Reinforce diet education. Discussed carb counting basics.
   - MUST complete eye exam - rescheduled with reminder

2. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy - stable but persistent. Continue monitoring.
   Will consider gabapentin if pain component worsens.

3. Hyperlipidemia - LDL improved to 112 on statin. Still above goal <100.
   Continue atorvastatin, may increase if not improved.

4. Hypertension - at goal today. Continue lisinopril.

5. Obesity - good progress! Lost 4 lbs. Encouraged to continue.

Discussed importance of medication compliance at length. Offered pill organizer.
Patient's wife was present today and will help remind him to take medications.

RTC 3 months. Will call pharmacy to set up automatic refill reminders.
