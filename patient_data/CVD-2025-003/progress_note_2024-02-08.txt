Assessment/Plan:
1. NEW DIAGNOSIS - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:
   - Fasting glucose 186, HbA1c 7.4% confirms diagnosis
   - Symptomatic with classic triad (polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue)
   - Also has peripheral neuropathy symptoms - start evaluation
   - START Metformin 500mg BID, titrate to 1000mg BID as tolerated
   - Diabetes education class scheduled (Spanish-speaking educator)
   - Home glucose monitoring ordered - will teach today
   - Nutrition referral placed
   - Ophthalmology referral for diabetic eye exam

2. Peripheral neuropathy - likely diabetic given above. Diminished monofilament
   testing. B12 level ordered to rule out deficiency. Foot care education provided.

3. Hyperlipidemia - LDL 148, HDL low. High ASCVD risk. START Atorvastatin 20mg
   daily.

4. Hypertension - BP improved but still borderline. Given new DM diagnosis and
   high CV risk, will start Lisinopril 10mg daily (also provides renal protection).

5. Obesity - BMI 33.7. Part of metabolic syndrome. Weight loss goal 5-10%.

6. Tobacco - counseled again on cessation importance especially with new diagnoses.

Spent considerable time educating patient about diabetes through interpreter.
He was surprised by diagnosis - "but I don't feel that sick." Explained importance
of controlling blood sugar to prevent complications. He understands and agrees to
start medications and lifestyle changes.

Prescriptions sent electronically. RTC 4 weeks. Sooner if any problems with
medications or concerning symptoms.
