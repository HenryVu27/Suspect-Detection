Patient: Miguel Fernandez    DOB: 11/30/1975    MRN: 34567890
Date: 2024-10-18       Provider: Dr. Elena Rodriguez, MD
Interpreter: Spanish interpreter (phone)

Chief Complaint: DM f/u, fatigue, "heart racing"

Subjective:
Pt presents for routine follow-up. Main concern today is occasional episodes of
"heart racing" and "pounding in chest" - started about 1 month ago. Happens 1-2x/week,
lasts few minutes, then goes away. No chest pain with episodes. No syncope or near
syncope. Not clearly related to activity.

Also reports ongoing fatigue - "I thought it would get better with the diabetes
medicine but I'm still so tired."

Diabetes: Home glucoses "better" - fasting 120-150 mostly. Taking medications as
prescribed now - wife puts them in pill organizer every week.

Still has foot tingling at night.

Completed eye exam in September - told "some early changes" but will repeat in 1 year.

Tried to quit smoking - down to 1-2 cigarettes/week only.

Review of Systems:
- Palpitations: as above
- Fatigue: persistent, daily
- Sleep: disrupted by nocturia and foot discomfort
- No CP, SOB at rest
- Some DOE with heavy lifting at work

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/82, HR 84 (regular), RR 16, Wt 206 lbs (-4 more lbs), BMI 32.3
General: Appears tired but NAD
CV: RRR, no murmurs, no irregular beats noted on exam
Lungs: Clear
Ext: No edema

Labs from 10/10:
- HbA1c: 7.2% (improved!)
- Fasting glucose: 138
- Cr: 1.0, eGFR >60
- Potassium: 4.2
- TSH: 2.4 (normal)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Type 2 Diabetes - IMPROVED! A1c down to 7.2% from 7.8%. Patient and wife's
   efforts paying off. Continue current regimen.

2. New onset palpitations - concerning symptom. Not clearly explained by current
   conditions. Differential includes:
   - Atrial fibrillation (risk factors: DM, HTN, obesity)
   - PVCs/PACs
   - Thyroid (TSH normal)
   - Anxiety
   ORDER: ECG today, Holter monitor 48 hours
   If AFib detected, will need anticoagulation evaluation

3. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy - stable. ADD Gabapentin 100mg TID for
   symptomatic relief. Titrate as needed.

4. Chronic fatigue - multifactorial. Diabetes improving but fatigue persists.
   Consider: sleep quality (nocturia, discomfort), possible OSA (obese, snores
   per wife), anemia, depression. Will screen at next visit if not improving.

5. Hypertension - well controlled. Continue lisinopril.

6. Obesity - great progress with weight loss! Total 9 lbs lost. Encourage continue.

7. Diabetic retinopathy - mild per ophthalmology. Will need annual exams.

8. Tobacco - nearly quit. Praised progress. Encouraged complete cessation.

ECG performed today - shows normal sinus rhythm, no acute changes. Will await
Holter results.

RTC 6 weeks to review Holter and reassess symptoms.
