ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)
================================================================================
"I worry about my health now. I didn't know I had diabetes until this year.
My mother has diabetes and my brother too - I saw what happened to them. I don't
want to lose my feet or my eyes like my mother's friend.

I am trying to do better with food and medicine. My wife helps me a lot. But
work is hard - I can't always eat good food, and sometimes I'm too tired to do
anything but sleep.

The new heart racing thing scares me. My father died of heart attack at my age.
I don't want to leave my family like he left us.

I wish I could understand better what the doctor tells me. Even with interpreter
it's hard sometimes. There's so much to remember."
