Patient: William O'Brien    DOB: 02/28/1950    MRN: 56789012

Chief Complaint: Follow-up multiple chronic conditions

Subjective:
74 y/o M with extensive cardiac history here for routine follow-up. Overall feeling
"not too bad for an old man." Main concerns today are occasional dizziness when
standing up quickly and persistent cough x 2 months.

Dizziness: Happens mainly when getting out of bed or chair quickly. No falls.
No true vertigo. No syncope. Feels lightheaded for few seconds then resolves.

Cough: Dry, non-productive, no hemoptysis. No fevers/chills. No dyspnea at rest.
Some mild SOB with exertion but stable from baseline. Former smoker - quit 10 years
ago after 40 pack-years.

Cardiac: Denies chest pain. Occasional palpitations, same as usual (has afib).
No worsening edema. Taking all medications.

Reports mild forgetfulness - "can't remember names like I used to." Wife helps
with medications. Mood okay.

PMH: CAD s/p CABG (2015), AFib, HTN, HLD, DM2, CKD3, BPH, GERD, osteoarthritis,
     h/o TIA (2019)
Allergies: Lisinopril (cough)

Current Medications:
- Warfarin (dose varies per INR)
- Metoprolol succinate 50mg daily
- Losartan 50mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80mg daily
- Metformin 500mg BID
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily
- Aspirin 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/76 sitting, 122/68 standing (orthostatic drop), HR 68 (irregular),
       RR 16, Temp 97.8F, Wt 178 lbs, SpO2 94% RA
General: Elderly male, NAD, appears stated age
HEENT: MMM, no pharyngeal erythema
Neck: No LAD, carotid bruits present bilaterally
CV: Irregularly irregular, II/VI systolic murmur at apex (known MR), no S3
Lungs: Diminished at bases, no crackles, no wheezes. Occasional dry cough
       during exam.
Abd: Soft, NT
Ext: Trace edema bilateral, DP pulses 1+
Neuro: A&Ox3, slight delay in recall, MMSE not performed today

Assessment/Plan:
1. Orthostatic hypotension - symptomatic. Likely multifactorial: age, multiple
   BP meds, autonomic dysfunction from DM. HOLD amlodipine (was on prior).
   Increase fluids, compression stockings. Rise slowly from sitting/lying.
   Recheck BP in 2 weeks.

2. Chronic cough - 2 months duration in former heavy smoker. Concerning given
   smoking history. Not on ACE-I (was stopped previously due to cough).
   ORDER CT CHEST to evaluate for mass/nodule given smoking history.
   If negative, consider GERD-related cough (on PPI), post-nasal drip.

3. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled on metoprolol. On warfarin for
   anticoagulation (CHA2DS2-VASc = 6). Check INR today.

4. CAD s/p CABG - stable, no angina. Continue ASA, statin.

5. Hypertension - slightly above goal but with orthostatic symptoms. Do not
   intensify therapy. May need to reduce BP meds if orthostasis persists.

6. Type 2 diabetes - last A1c 7.1%, acceptable for age. Continue metformin.

7. CKD stage 3 - last Cr 1.5, eGFR 48. Stable. Continue monitoring.

8. Cognitive concerns - mild forgetfulness, likely age-related. No red flags.
   Consider formal cognitive screening at next visit or annual wellness.

9. BPH - stable on tamsulosin.

10. Health maintenance - Flu shot today. Pneumovax up to date.

INR today: 2.4 (therapeutic). Continue current warfarin dose.

CT chest ordered. Will call with results. RTC 4 weeks.
