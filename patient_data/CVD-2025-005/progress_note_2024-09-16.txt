Chief Complaint: Annual wellness visit, fall at home

Subjective:
74 y/o M here for annual wellness. Main concern today is a fall last week -
tripped over rug at home, fell forward, hit shoulder on doorframe. Mild pain
but able to move arm. Did not hit head. No LOC. No dizziness or lightheadedness
at time of fall - was just not watching where he was going.

Otherwise feeling okay. Denies chest pain, SOB same as baseline. Occasional
palpitations (baseline AFib). No fevers, no cough now.

Wife reports cognitive status about the same - "good days and bad days." He
managed the fall well, got up on his own, called her right away.

Still taking all medications. No issues with compliance.

Review of Systems:
- Fall: as above
- MSK: right shoulder mild pain
- Otherwise negative

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/72, HR 70 (irregular), RR 16, SpO2 95% RA, Wt 172 lbs (-2 lbs)
General: NAD, pleasant
HEENT: No scalp tenderness, no facial injuries
Neck: Supple, carotid bruits present
CV: Irregularly irregular, known murmur
Lungs: Clear
MSK: R shoulder - mild tenderness at AC joint, FROM limited by pain, no deformity,
     neurovascularly intact distally
Ext: No edema
Neuro: A&Ox3, steady gait observed

MMSE performed: 26/30 (lost points: delayed recall 2/3, orientation to date 1)
This is consistent with mild cognitive impairment.

Assessment/Plan:
1. Fall - mechanical (tripped), not syncopal. No head injury. R shoulder contusion,
   no fracture suspected clinically. X-ray if not improving in 1 week. Home safety
   eval discussed - remove throw rugs, improve lighting.

2. Mild cognitive impairment - MMSE 26/30 confirms MCI. Discussed with patient
   and wife. Not dementia level at this time but warrants monitoring. Referral
   to neurology for evaluation if interested. Patient declines at this time -
   "I'm doing okay." Will repeat screening in 6-12 months.

3. Atrial fibrillation - stable. Fall risk counseled given anticoagulation.
   Continue warfarin with close monitoring.

4. CAD, HTN, DM2 - all stable on current regimen.

5. CKD stage 3b - stable. Last eGFR 45.

6. Weight loss - 2 lbs since last visit. Patient states poor appetite some days.
   Will monitor - if continues, further workup.

7. Health maintenance:
   - Flu shot: given today
   - Pneumovax: up to date
   - Tdap: up to date
   - Shingrix: recommend completing series - patient had 1st dose, needs 2nd

Advanced care planning: Discussed with patient and wife. Has healthcare proxy
designated (wife). Full code status confirmed. Will discuss further at future visits.

RTC 3 months or PRN for shoulder if not improving.
