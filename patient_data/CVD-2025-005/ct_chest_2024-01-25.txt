RADIOLOGY REPORT

Patient: William O'Brien    DOB: 02/28/1950    MRN: 56789012
Exam: CT Chest without contrast
Date of Exam: 2024-01-25
Ordering Provider: Dr. Thomas McCarthy, MD
Interpreting Radiologist: Dr. Susan Lee, MD

================================================================================
CLINICAL INDICATION
================================================================================
74-year-old male with chronic cough for 2 months. History of 40 pack-year smoking,
quit 10 years ago. Evaluate for pulmonary mass.

================================================================================
TECHNIQUE
================================================================================
Non-contrast CT of the chest was performed with thin-section imaging.
Comparison: Chest X-ray 2022-03-15

================================================================================
FINDINGS
================================================================================

LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:
- No pulmonary mass or consolidation identified to explain the patient's cough.
- Mild centrilobular and paraseptal emphysematous changes in the upper lobes
  bilaterally, consistent with smoking history.
- 8mm non-calcified nodule in the right lower lobe (series 4, image 182),
  subpleural location. This is indeterminate and new compared to chest X-ray
  from 2022 (nodule not visualized on radiograph, likely below detection threshold).
- No additional pulmonary nodules identified.
- Airways are patent. No endobronchial lesion.

PLEURA:
- Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, estimated less than
  100 mL each side. Likely related to patient's known cardiac disease.
- No pneumothorax.

MEDIASTINUM:
- Post-surgical changes from prior CABG with sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips.
- Heart size is mildly enlarged.
- No pathological mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (no nodes >1 cm short axis).
- Calcified coronary arteries consistent with atherosclerotic disease.

CHEST WALL:
- Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
- No suspicious osseous lesions.

LIMITED UPPER ABDOMEN:
- Liver, spleen, adrenal glands unremarkable on limited views.

================================================================================
IMPRESSION
================================================================================
1. No pulmonary mass or consolidation to explain patient's chronic cough.

2. Mild emphysematous changes consistent with smoking history.

3. Post-surgical changes from prior CABG.

4. 8mm NON-CALCIFIED NODULE IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. This is indeterminate
   and represents a new finding. Given the patient's significant smoking history
   (40 pack-years), this nodule carries a moderate risk of malignancy.

   RECOMMENDATION: Per Fleischner Society guidelines for high-risk patients,
   follow-up CT chest in 3 MONTHS is recommended to assess for interval growth.
   If stable at 3 months, continued surveillance may be needed. Please ensure
   timely follow-up imaging is scheduled.

5. Small bilateral pleural effusions, likely cardiac-related.
