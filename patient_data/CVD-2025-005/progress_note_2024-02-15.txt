PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: William O'Brien    DOB: 02/28/1950    MRN: 56789012
Date: 2024-02-15       Provider: Dr. Thomas McCarthy, MD

Chief Complaint: Follow-up orthostasis, CT results

Subjective:
Pt returns for scheduled follow-up. Reports dizziness has improved somewhat since
stopping amlodipine and increasing fluids. Still happens occasionally but no falls.
Using compression stockings as recommended.

Cough: Persists but maybe slightly better. Still dry. No hemoptysis.

Otherwise stable. No chest pain, no worsening SOB. Edema about the same.

CT CHEST RESULTS (performed 1/25/24):
"Impression:
1. No evidence of pulmonary mass or consolidation to explain cough.
2. Mild emphysematous changes consistent with smoking history.
3. Post-surgical changes from prior CABG.
4. 8mm non-calcified nodule in right lower lobe, indeterminate. Given smoking
   history, recommend follow-up CT in 3 months per Fleischner Society guidelines.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions, likely related to known cardiac disease."

Objective:
Vitals: BP 134/78 sitting, 126/72 standing (improved orthostasis), HR 72 (irr),
       SpO2 95% RA, Wt 176 lbs
General: NAD
CV: Irregularly irregular, known murmur present
Lungs: Diminished bases, no crackles, occasional cough

Assessment/Plan:
1. Orthostatic hypotension - improving. Continue current management without
   amlodipine. BP controlled.

2. Chronic cough with CT findings:
   - No mass to explain cough, likely GERD or post-nasal drip. Continue PPI.
   - NOTE: 8mm RLL nodule identified. Per radiology, needs f/u CT in 3 months.
     Discussed with patient and wife - they understand need for repeat scan.
     Will order for May timeframe.
   - Mild emphysema consistent with smoking history, no treatment needed.

3. Small pleural effusions - likely from cardiac disease. Will monitor clinically.
   No intervention needed currently.

4. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled. INR today 2.6 (therapeutic).

5. Other chronic conditions - stable. Continue current management.

Repeat CT chest to be scheduled for ~May 2024. Will discuss results when available.
RTC 2-3 months unless concerns.
