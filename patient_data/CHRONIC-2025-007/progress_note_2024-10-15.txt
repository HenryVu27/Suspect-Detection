PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Frank Morrison    DOB: 09/25/1952    MRN: 91234567
Date: 2024-10-15       Provider: Dr. Susan Taylor, MD (Pulmonology)

Chief Complaint: COPD routine follow-up

Subjective:
72 yo M with severe COPD returns for routine follow-up. No exacerbations since
February - very pleased with roflumilast addition. "Best stretch I've had in years."

Completed 6-week pulmonary rehab program - "tough but helpful." Feels stronger,
breathing exercises help with anxiety about SOB.

QUIT SMOKING in April! Using nicotine lozenges occasionally. Bupropion continued.
Wife also quit - "easier when we both did it."

Using rescue inhaler 1-2x/day now, mainly with exertion. Sleeps flat in bed most
nights. Still uses O2 with exertion.

Reports some constipation since starting roflumilast - bothersome but manageable.
Also notes "achy joints" especially in the morning - hands, knees. Lasts about
30 min, improves with movement.

Current Medications:
- Trelegy Ellipta 100/62.5/25 one puff daily
- Albuterol HFA PRN
- Roflumilast 500mcg daily
- Bupropion SR 150mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Simvastatin 40mg QHS
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Clopidogrel 75mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Home O2 2L with activity

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/76, HR 78, RR 16, SpO2 92% RA, 96% on 2L
General: Appears well, good spirits, less dyspneic at rest
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds, scattered rhonchi, no wheezes
CV: RRR
Ext: No edema. Mild bony enlargement DIP joints bilateral, Heberden's nodes noted
MSK: Full ROM hands, some crepitus knees

PFTs:
- FEV1: 1.02 L (38% predicted) - improved back to baseline!
- FEV1/FVC: 0.49

Assessment/Plan:
1. COPD severe (GOLD III) - STABLE, no exacerbations in 8 months! Best interval
   in years. PFTs improved to baseline. Continue current regimen including
   roflumilast. Pulm rehab completed - encourage continued home exercises.
2. TOBACCO USE DISORDER - QUIT! 6 months smoke-free! Congratulations. Continue
   bupropion for now, can consider taper in 6-12 months.
3. Osteoarthritis - NEW finding on exam. Joint symptoms and Heberden's nodes
   consistent with OA. Not in problem list. Recommend adding. Acetaminophen PRN
   preferred over NSAIDs given CAD/aspirin use.
4. CAD - stable.
5. Osteoporosis - continue alendronate. DEXA due next year.
6. Roflumilast side effects - GI side effects (constipation) are common. Can try
   fiber supplement. Tolerable so continue.
7. Vaccines - flu shot given today. Next Prevnar due 2025.

RTC 4 months. Doing great - encouraged.
