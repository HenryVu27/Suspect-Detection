PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Frank Morrison    DOB: 09/25/1952    MRN: 91234567

Chief Complaint: Follow-up COPD exacerbation

Subjective:
Pt returns after completing prednisone and azithromycin. Reports SOB "much better"
but still not back to baseline. Walking to mailbox now okay, can do one flight of
stairs with rest. Cough resolved, sputum now clear. No fever.

Started bupropion - tolerating well. Has cut down to 5 cigarettes per day. "Trying
hard, doc."

Still using rescue inhaler 3x/day.

Current Medications:
- Trelegy Ellipta 100/62.5/25 one puff daily
- Albuterol HFA PRN
- Bupropion SR 150mg daily (just started, to increase to BID)
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Simvastatin 40mg QHS
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Clopidogrel 75mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Home O2 2L with activity

Objective:
Vitals: BP 132/78, HR 84, RR 18, SpO2 91% RA, 95% on 2L
General: Appears better, less labored breathing
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds, end-expiratory wheezes, improved from last week
CV: RRR

PFTs (performed today):
- FEV1: 0.95 L (35% predicted) - down from 38% baseline
- FEV1/FVC: 0.48
- TLC: increased (air trapping)
- DLCO: 40% predicted

Assessment/Plan:
1. COPD exacerbation - resolving but PFTs show persistent decline. FEV1 now 35%
   (was 38%). This is 2nd exacerbation in 12 months. Consider:
   - Roflumilast for exacerbation prevention - starting 500mcg daily
   - Pulmonary rehabilitation referral
   - Annual flu and Prevnar vaccines updated
2. Tobacco use disorder - improved on bupropion! Continue and increase to BID.
   Encouraged continued efforts. Even reduction helps.
3. COPD chronic management - already on triple therapy. Consider azithromycin
   prophylaxis (250mg 3x/week) if another exacerbation occurs.
4. Oxygen - continue current prescription. Will need reassessment.

RTC 6 weeks. Pulm rehab referral placed. Roflumilast started.
