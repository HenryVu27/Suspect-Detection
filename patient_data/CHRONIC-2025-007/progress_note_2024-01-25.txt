Chief Complaint: COPD follow-up, increased dyspnea

Subjective:
71 yo M with severe COPD here for routine follow-up. Reports increased SOB over
past month - now getting winded walking to mailbox (~50 yards). Using rescue
inhaler 4-5x/day (was 2x). Has had to sleep in recliner last 2 nights due to
orthopnea.

Still smoking - admits "down to 10 cigarettes but can't seem to quit completely."
Used nicotine patch for a week but "it made my skin itch." Not interested in
Chantix - "tried it before, gave me bad dreams."

Productive cough - yellow-green sputum x3 days. No fever, no chills. No hemoptysis.
Some wheezing at night.

No chest pain, no leg swelling. Takes medications as prescribed. Uses home O2
at 2L with activity.

Current Medications:
- Trelegy Ellipta 100/62.5/25 one puff daily
- Albuterol HFA PRN (using frequently)
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Simvastatin 40mg QHS
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Clopidogrel 75mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Home oxygen 2L with activity

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/82, HR 92, RR 22, Temp 98.8F, Wt 168 lbs (stable), SpO2 88% RA,
       93% on 2L NC
General: Thin male, appears dyspneic at rest, speaking in short sentences
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds throughout, scattered expiratory wheezes, prolonged
       expiratory phase, no crackles
CV: Tachycardic, regular
Ext: No edema, no cyanosis

Assessment/Plan:
1. COPD severe (GOLD III) - acute exacerbation, likely infectious component given
   productive cough with purulent sputum. Not severe enough for hospitalization
   currently but concerning.
   - Start prednisone 40mg daily x5 days
   - Start azithromycin 250mg: 500mg day 1, then 250mg x4 days
   - Increase albuterol frequency - okay to use every 4 hours while symptomatic
   - Continue Trelegy
   - Close follow-up in 1 week
   - ACTION plan reviewed: ED if worsening SOB, fever, confusion
   - Home pulse ox provided - instructions to call if <88% at rest on 2L
2. Tobacco use disorder - still smoking despite severe COPD. Cannot emphasize enough
   importance of cessation. Offered varenicline again - declined. Will try Wellbutrin
   as it may help anxiety as well. Start bupropion SR 150mg daily, increase to BID
   after 1 week.
3. CAD - stable. Continue DAPT.
4. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin.
5. Osteoporosis - steroids again. Continue alendronate. May need to consider
   alternative if recurrent exacerbations requiring steroids.
6. Anxiety - stable. Bupropion may help; continue buspirone.

RTC 1 week. Sooner if worsening.
