ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)

"MS has been my constant challenge for the past 12 years. I was diagnosed at 33 -
I was otherwise healthy, just had some numbness in my leg that didn't go away.
Then came the MRI and the diagnosis that changed everything.

I've been through a lot of treatments. Started with Avonex (interferon) but
couldn't tolerate the side effects. Then Tecfidera, which worked for a while.
Now I'm on Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), which has been the best so far. I get an
infusion every 6 months and haven't had a relapse in over 2 years.

The fatigue is the hardest part. People don't see it - I look healthy. But by
mid-afternoon I'm running on empty. I've had to adjust my work schedule - I do
the important stuff in the morning when I have energy. My boss has been
understanding.

I worry about the future. MS is unpredictable. I could be stable for years or
I could progress. The not knowing is hard. I've read about people in wheelchairs,
people who can't work. I try not to go there but sometimes it keeps me up at night.

I'm grateful for my family. My wife is amazing - she takes on extra when I'm
having a bad day. My kids are old enough to understand now. They've been
researching MS for school projects. It's touching.

I stay active because studies show it helps MS. Swimming is great because the
pool is cool (heat makes symptoms worse). I do what I can when I can.

The depression is real. Hard to stay positive when you have a chronic disease.
The bupropion helps and so does therapy. I've learned to take it day by day."
