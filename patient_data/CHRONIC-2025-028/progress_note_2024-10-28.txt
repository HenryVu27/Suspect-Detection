PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Christopher Martinez    DOB: 03/30/1979    MRN: 34567123
Date: 2024-10-28       Provider: Dr. Amy Nguyen, MD (Neurology/MS)

Chief Complaint: New symptoms, concern for relapse or progression

Subjective:
Pt called urgent line with new symptoms developing over past 3 weeks. Came in
for same-day evaluation.

NEW/WORSENING SYMPTOMS:
- Right leg weakness: "Dragging my leg more. Tripping over my foot."
  Progressive over 3 weeks. Not sudden onset.
- Gait worsening: "Can barely make it to the end of the driveway now."
  Was walking half mile 6 months ago.
- Increased spasticity: "My legs feel stiff and tight."
- Balance problems: "Almost fell twice this week."
- NEW: Right hand weakness and clumsiness: "Dropping things. Hard to button
  shirt." Started about 1 week ago.
- NEW: Mild cognitive changes: "Having trouble finding words. Forgetting things
  at work." Wife confirms - "He asked me the same question three times yesterday."
- Fatigue: Worse than baseline.

Denies: Fever, recent infections, vision changes, vertigo, severe headache.

No missed ocrelizumab infusions. Last was September 2024.

Temperature at home: Normal.

Current Medications: Unchanged from last visit.

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/82, HR 72, Temp 98.2°F, Wt 182 lbs
General: Appears fatigued, anxious
Neuro Exam:
  - Mental status: Alert, oriented. Word-finding difficulty noted during exam.
    Delayed recall (2/3 at 5 min). MOCA performed: 24/30 (was not formally tested
    before but no concerns historically)
  - Cranial nerves: Left pupil sluggish (old), otherwise intact
  - Motor: Right lower extremity 4/5 hip flexion, 4/5 knee flexion/extension,
           4/5 ankle dorsiflexion (NEW weakness)
           Right upper extremity 4+/5 grip, 4+/5 finger abduction (NEW weakness)
           Left side 5/5
  - Sensory: Decreased vibration right ankle
  - Reflexes: Right knee 3+ (hyperreflexic), Babinski positive right (NEW)
  - Coordination: Mild intention tremor right hand
  - Gait: Marked right leg circumduction, foot drop noted, requires support to
          walk safely, unable to tandem walk

EDSS today: 4.5 (UP from 2.5 - significant worsening!!)

Assessment/Plan:
***CONCERNING FOR MS PROGRESSION - NEED URGENT EVALUATION***

Clinical picture is ATYPICAL for simple relapse:
- Gradual progression over 3+ weeks (relapses usually peak within days to 1-2 weeks)
- Cognitive involvement (new)
- Progressive worsening without clear plateau
- On highly effective therapy with prior good control

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) - conversion from RRMS
   - Most concerning - gradual accumulation without clear relapses
2. MS relapse (atypical presentation)
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - MUST RULE OUT given
   B-cell depleting therapy, though very rare with ocrelizumab
4. Other CNS infection/process

URGENT WORKUP:
1. MRI brain AND spine with contrast - ordered STAT (today if possible)
   - Looking for: New T2 lesions, gadolinium enhancement, PML pattern,
     spinal cord lesion
2. Lumbar puncture after MRI if no contraindication:
   - CSF: Cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands
   - JC virus PCR (PML evaluation - critical given immunosuppression)
   - Cytology
3. Labs: CBC, CMP, B12, Vitamin D, quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG levels
   can drop on ocrelizumab)

MANAGEMENT PENDING RESULTS:
- HOLD next ocrelizumab infusion until PML ruled out
- If MRI shows new active lesions without PML pattern → IV steroids
- If concerning for SPMS → therapy discussion, consider different DMT

SAFETY:
- Fall risk HIGH. Discussed home safety, assistive device. Ordered rollator.
- Physical therapy evaluation urgent
- No driving until evaluated further

Patient and wife educated on concerning nature of symptoms. Understand need
for urgent testing. MRI scheduled for this afternoon. Will call with results.

ADDENDUM 10/28/2024 5:30 PM:

MRI RESULTS (reviewed with neuroradiology):

BRAIN:
- Multiple new T2 hyperintense lesions (5+) compared to February 2024
- Two lesions show gadolinium enhancement (active inflammation)
- NO PATTERN CONSISTENT WITH PML (no involvement of subcortical U-fibers,
  no typical PML distribution)
- Increased volume loss compared to prior

SPINE (Cervical and Thoracic):
- NEW T2 hyperintense lesion at C3-C4 level with mild enhancement
- Cord expansion at this level - consistent with active myelitis

IMPRESSION: Active MS disease with new brain and spinal cord lesions despite
ocrelizumab therapy. No evidence of PML. Pattern concerning for breakthrough
disease activity.

PLAN:
- Start IV methylprednisolone 1g daily x 5 days (beginning tomorrow AM)
- Still obtain LP to confirm no atypical infection and for prognostic markers
- Discussed with patient: Despite being on highly effective therapy, MS has
  become active. May represent transition to SPMS with superimposed relapses.
- After steroids, will need disease therapy reassessment - options include
  continuing ocrelizumab vs. alternative (natalizumab if JCV negative).
- Prognosis discussion - condition is worsening, may not return to prior baseline

Patient understands severity. Very emotional but accepting. Wife supportive.
Will admit for IV steroids tomorrow.
