Walking: Can walk about half a mile before needing to rest. Uses no assistive
device. Slight limp when fatigued.

Assessment/Plan:
1. Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting - STABLE on ocrelizumab. No relapses
   since 2022. No MRI progression. EDSS stable at 2.5.
   - Continue ocrelizumab every 6 months
   - Next MRI brain in 1 year
   - Vaccinations: Ensure up to date (avoid live vaccines on ocrelizumab)
     Flu and COVID vaccines recommended. Review pneumonia vaccine status.

2. MS Fatigue - chronic. Modafinil somewhat helpful.
   - Continue modafinil PRN
   - Discussed importance of pacing, adequate sleep
   - May consider amantadine if modafinil insufficient

3. Neurogenic Bladder - managed on oxybutynin. Consider urology referral if
   worsening.

4. Depression - stable on bupropion. Continue therapy.

5. Vitamin D - level adequate. Continue supplementation.

6. Infection monitoring - on B-cell depleting therapy. Low threshold for
   antibiotics if URI symptoms. Report any fevers promptly.

Continue current regimen. RTC 6 months (around next infusion).
