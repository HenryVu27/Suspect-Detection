IMAGING REPORT - MRI BRAIN AND SPINE

Patient: Christopher Martinez    DOB: 03/30/1979    MRN: 34567123
Exam Date: 2024-10-28 14:30
Ordering Provider: Dr. Amy Nguyen, MD
Reading Radiologist: Dr. Jennifer Wilson, MD (Neuroradiology)

================================================================================
EXAMINATION: MRI Brain with and without contrast, MRI Cervical Spine with and
without contrast, MRI Thoracic Spine with and without contrast

CLINICAL INDICATION: Multiple sclerosis on ocrelizumab with new progressive
right-sided weakness, gait worsening, cognitive changes. Rule out progression
vs. PML vs. new relapse.

COMPARISON: MRI Brain 02/15/2024

TECHNIQUE: 3T MRI with multiplanar T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI sequences, pre and post
gadolinium.

================================================================================
BRAIN FINDINGS:

WHITE MATTER LESIONS:
- Previously seen periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions (>15)
- ***5+ NEW T2 hyperintense lesions*** identified since February 2024:
  * New 12mm lesion right centrum semiovale
  * New 8mm lesion left periventricular region
  * New 7mm lesion right corona radiata (corticospinal tract involvement -
    correlates with left weakness)
  * New 6mm lesion left frontal subcortical white matter
  * New 5mm lesion right parietal subcortical region
- Several previously seen lesions appear slightly larger

GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT:
- ***Two lesions show gadolinium enhancement:***
  * Right corona radiata lesion - ring enhancement
  * Left frontal subcortical lesion - nodular enhancement
- Enhancement indicates active/recent demyelination

DAWSON'S FINGERS: Present periventricularly - classic MS pattern

CORPUS CALLOSUM: Multiple T2 hyperintensities at calloso-septal interface -
typical MS pattern

INFRATENTORIAL: No new brainstem or cerebellar lesions

GRAY MATTER: Possible subtle cortical/juxtacortical involvement

ATROPHY:
- ***Progressive brain volume loss*** compared to 2024
- Evans ratio mildly increased (0.31)
- Sulcal widening more prominent

BLACK HOLES (T1 hypointense): Several chronic lesions show T1 hypointensity -
represent axonal loss/gliosis

PML EVALUATION:
- NO involvement of subcortical U-fibers in typical PML distribution
- No asymmetric, confluent frontal or parieto-occipital lesions
- No "leading edge" pattern
- Enhancement pattern atypical for PML
- ***Imaging does NOT suggest PML***

================================================================================
CERVICAL SPINE FINDINGS:

***NEW CERVICAL CORD LESION:***
- T2 hyperintense lesion at C3-C4 level, posterolateral cord
- Measures approximately 8mm craniocaudal
- Mild cord expansion at this level
- Gadolinium enhancement present - ACTIVE LESION
- This lesion correlates with patient's right-sided symptoms (left lateral
  corticospinal tract)

No other spinal cord lesions identified in cervical region.

================================================================================
THORACIC SPINE FINDINGS:

- T2 hyperintense lesion at T6 level, posterior cord - stable from prior, no
  enhancement (chronic)
- No new thoracic lesions

================================================================================
IMPRESSION:

1. ***ACTIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WITH NEW DISEASE ACTIVITY despite highly
   effective therapy:***
   - 5+ new brain lesions since February 2024
   - 2 gadolinium-enhancing lesions (active inflammation)
   - New enhancing cervical cord lesion at C3-C4 (explains right-sided symptoms)
   - Progressive brain volume loss

2. ***NO EVIDENCE OF PML:***
   - Lesion pattern typical for MS, not PML
   - No subcortical U-fiber involvement
   - Enhancement pattern inconsistent with PML

3. Progressive brain atrophy - concerning for possible transition to
   secondary progressive MS

4. Chronic T2 lesion thoracic spine - stable, inactive

================================================================================
CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Findings indicate breakthrough MS disease activity on ocrelizumab with both
new lesions and active enhancement. The C3-C4 spinal cord lesion explains
the patient's right-sided weakness. New brain lesions may explain cognitive
changes. Progressive atrophy is concerning for transition toward secondary
progressive disease phase.

Recommend clinical correlation and consideration of treatment intensification
or modification.
