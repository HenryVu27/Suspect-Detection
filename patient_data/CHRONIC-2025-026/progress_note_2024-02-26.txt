Objective:
Vitals: BP 132/82, HR 70, Wt 268 lbs (down from 276), BMI 35
General: Obese male, no acute distress
Skin: No jaundice, no spider angiomata, no palmar erythema
Abdomen: Obese, soft, no ascites (negative fluid wave), liver not palpable,
         spleen tip palpable
Extremities: No peripheral edema

Labs (drawn today):
- CBC: WBC 5.8, Hgb 13.2, Plt 118 (low - thrombocytopenia)
- CMP: Cr 1.0, Na 140, K 4.2, glucose 152, albumin 3.6
- LFTs: AST 48, ALT 52, Alk phos 95, T bili 1.1, D bili 0.3
- INR: 1.2
- HbA1c: 7.2% (improved from 7.5%)

Calculated MELD-Na: 8 (stable)

FibroScan (today): 18.2 kPa (consistent with cirrhosis, stable from 17.8)

Ultrasound (last month): Cirrhotic liver morphology, no focal lesions, patent
portal vein, small spleen, no ascites.

Assessment/Plan:
1. NASH Cirrhosis - compensated, stable. MELD 8. No evidence of decompensation.
   - Continue HCC surveillance: Ultrasound every 6 months (next August)
   - Consider AFP at each visit
   - Continue lifestyle modifications - weight loss helping
   - FibroScan stable

2. Thrombocytopenia - platelets 118, stable. Consistent with hypersplenism from
   portal hypertension. No intervention needed.

3. Type 2 DM - improved HbA1c 7.2% (was 7.5%). Continue current regimen.
   Weight loss helping. Note: Metformin safe in compensated cirrhosis.

4. Obesity - BMI 35, down from 36.5. Weight loss 8 lbs - excellent. Continue
   efforts. Discussed that 10% weight loss can improve/stabilize NASH.

5. HTN - controlled on lisinopril.

6. OSA - compliant with CPAP.

7. Esophageal varices - EGD done 2022 showed small varices. Due for repeat EGD
   for surveillance (schedule).

Continue current regimen. RTC 6 months. Sooner if new symptoms.
