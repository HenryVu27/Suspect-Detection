Ultrasound (ordered STAT today):
- Cirrhotic liver, nodular contour
- ***NEW 2.8cm HYPERVASCULAR LESION in right hepatic lobe, segment 6***
- Moderate ascites (NEW)
- Patent portal vein (no thrombosis)
- Splenomegaly 14cm

Assessment/Plan:
***DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS WITH MULTIPLE CRITICAL FINDINGS***

1. HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION - New ascites, jaundice, coagulopathy, elevated MELD
   (8 to 18). First episode of decompensation.
   - Start diuretics: Furosemide 40mg daily + Spironolactone 100mg daily
   - STRICT sodium restriction <2g/day
   - Daily weights, target 1-2 lb loss/day
   - Stop metformin (now contraindicated)
   - May need paracentesis if tense ascites/discomfort
   - HOLD lisinopril (hypotension concern with diuretics)

2. HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY - Asterixis present, wife notes confusion/personality
   change. Elevated ammonia.
   - Start lactulose 30mL TID, titrate to 3-4 BM/day
   - Start rifaximin 550mg BID
   - Educate family on HE signs and when to seek emergency care

3. ***NEW LIVER LESION 2.8cm - HIGHLY CONCERNING FOR HCC***
   - AFP nearly doubled (4.2 to 8.4)
   - Hypervascular lesion on ultrasound in cirrhotic liver = HCC until proven
     otherwise
   - URGENT: Order MRI liver with contrast (Eovist) for LI-RADS classification
   - If LI-RADS 5, will need multidisciplinary tumor board discussion
   - Hepatology/oncology/transplant surgery involvement

4. Hyponatremia - Na 132. Dilutional from decompensation. Fluid restrict to
   1.5L/day.

5. Acute Kidney Injury - Cr 1.4 (baseline 1.0). Hepatorenal syndrome vs.
   prerenal. Hold lisinopril. Careful with diuretics. Monitor closely.

6. Diabetes - STOP METFORMIN (lactic acidosis risk in decompensation). Switch
   to insulin (start glargine 10 units QHS). Continue glipizide for now but
   monitor for hypoglycemia.

7. Varices - Given decompensation, start propranolol 20mg BID for portal
   hypertension/variceal prophylaxis. EGD soon for variceal assessment.

8. Transplant evaluation - Given decompensation and likely HCC, URGENT referral
   to transplant hepatology. MELD 18 + potential HCC exception points.

CRITICAL COMMUNICATION:
- Explained to patient and wife that liver disease has progressed significantly
- New lesion concerning for liver cancer - need MRI urgently
- May need to consider liver transplant evaluation
- Wife understands seriousness, patient tearful but accepting

MRI scheduled for 10/02. Will call with results.
Follow-up in 1 week. ER if confusion worsens, fever, GI bleeding.
