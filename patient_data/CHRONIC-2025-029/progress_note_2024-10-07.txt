PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: George Williams    DOB: 11/18/1950    MRN: 45678234
Date: 2024-10-07       Provider: Dr. Robert Kim, MD (Cardiology/Heart Failure)

Chief Complaint: Heart failure worsening, urgent visit

Subjective:
Pt called HF nurse line with concerning symptoms, brought in for same-day evaluation.

WORSENING SYMPTOMS over past 2 weeks:
- Weight gain: Up 8 lbs in 10 days despite "trying to be good with salt"
- Increased edema: Legs swollen to knees. "Can barely get shoes on."
- Worsening dyspnea: Now SOB with minimal activity - walking 20 feet to bathroom.
  Orthopnea - now needs 4 pillows to sleep (was 2)
- NEW: Waking gasping for air 2-3 nights this week (PND)
- Decreased exercise tolerance: Can't make it upstairs at all now
- Fatigue: "Exhausted all the time. Can barely get out of chair."
- Decreased appetite: "Food doesn't taste good. Feel full quickly."
- Decreased urine output: "Not urinating as much despite drinking fluids."

NEW: ICD shock 3 days ago. "Knocked me off my feet. Just one."

No fever, no chest pain, no recent illness.

Medications: Ran out of dapagliflozin 2 weeks ago. "Prescription needed refill
and I forgot to call." Has been taking all other medications.

Diet: States he's been compliant but wife interjects: "He had soup at the diner
last week. The salty kind."

Current Medications:
- Sacubitril-valsartan 97/103mg BID
- Carvedilol 25mg BID
- Dapagliflozin 10mg daily (NOT TAKING - ran out)
- Spironolactone 25mg daily
- Furosemide 40mg BID
- Apixaban 5mg BID
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80mg daily
- Insulin glargine 24 units QHS
- Insulin lispro sliding scale

Objective:
Vitals: BP 96/62 (low), HR 110 (irregularly irregular), RR 24, O2 sat 91% RA,
        Wt 206 lbs (UP 8 lbs from April!!)
General: Appears fatigued, mild respiratory distress at rest
JVP: 14cm (significantly elevated)
Cardiac: Irregularly irregular, tachycardic, S3 gallop present, soft systolic
         murmur (MR)
Lungs: Bibasilar crackles to mid-lung fields, decreased breath sounds bases
Abdomen: Hepatomegaly palpable, mild RUQ tenderness
Extremities: 3+ pitting edema bilateral to knees, cool

ICD Interrogation (today):
- AF with RVR: Average HR 105-115 past 2 weeks
- ONE APPROPRIATE ICD SHOCK 3 days ago - VT episode terminated
- AF burden: 100%

Labs (STAT today):
- BNP: 2,450 (markedly elevated, was 450!!)
- CMP: Na 132 (low), K 5.2, Cr 2.4 (UP from 1.8), BUN 58, glucose 195
- CBC: Hgb 10.8 (down)
- Troponin: 0.08 (mildly elevated)
- Lactate: 1.8

CXR (portable):
- Cardiomegaly
- Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate
- Pulmonary vascular congestion
- Interstitial edema

Assessment/Plan:
***ACUTE ON CHRONIC HEART FAILURE EXACERBATION - SEVERE***

1. Acute HF Exacerbation - ADMIT TO HOSPITAL
   - Clinical profile: Wet and cold (congested with hypoperfusion signs)
   - Triggers identified: SGLT2i nonadherence x2 weeks, dietary indiscretion,
     possible uncontrolled afib contributing
   - Immediate management:
     * IV furosemide 80mg bolus now, then 10mg/hr continuous infusion
     * Strict I/O, daily weights
     * Telemetry monitoring
     * Oxygen supplementation to maintain O2 >92%
     * HOLD sacubitril-valsartan temporarily (hypotension)
   - If no response to diuresis, may need inotropic support or ultrafiltration
   - RESTART dapagliflozin once stabilized - CRITICAL medication

2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR - contributing to decompensation
   - Rate control inadequate on carvedilol alone
   - Add IV digoxin load (0.25mg x2 doses) then 0.125mg daily (renally dose)
   - Goal HR <100

3. ICD therapy - APPROPRIATE shock for VT. Will review full device data with
   EP. May need VT ablation evaluation if recurrent.

4. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD - Cr 1.8 → 2.4. Cardiorenal syndrome. May worsen
   with diuresis but benefit outweighs risk. Hold dapagliflozin until renal
   function stabilizes.

5. Hyponatremia - Na 132. Dilutional from HF. Fluid restrict 1.5L/day.

6. Troponin elevation - Type 2 MI (demand ischemia from afib RVR). Not ACS.

7. Goals of care - Will discuss with patient and family. Advanced HF options
   (LVAD, transplant) may need to be considered if continues to decline.
   Patient is 73 - borderline candidate.

ADMISSION ORDERS PLACED. Called daughter to update.
