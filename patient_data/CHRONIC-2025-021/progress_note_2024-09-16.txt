PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Harold Nakamura    DOB: 04/12/1941    MRN: 67890456
Date: 2024-09-16       Provider: Dr. Lisa Chen, MD (Neurology)

Chief Complaint: Dementia follow-up, concerning changes per wife

Subjective:
Pt returns for routine follow-up but wife called ahead with concerns. Helen
appears stressed today.

Per wife: "Things have gotten worse the last month or two." Reports:
- Increased confusion - doesn't recognize neighborhood anymore
- Getting day/night mixed up - found him dressed at 3am thinking it was morning
- New behavior: Accusing wife of moving his things, hiding things
- Increased irritability - "He snapped at our grandson last week, never done that"
- One episode of urinary incontinence last week
- Needing more help with dressing - buttons and zippers are hard

Wife tearfully: "I don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm not sleeping."

Per patient: Seems unaware of changes. "I'm fine. She worries too much."

Tolerating memantine and donepezil - titrated to full dose per instructions.

No falls. Eating well though wife has to supervise meals now.

Current Medications:
- Donepezil 10mg QHS
- Memantine 10mg BID
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Atorvastatin 20mg daily
- Tamsulosin 0.4mg QHS
- Aspirin 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/74, HR 72, Wt 165 lbs (down 3 lbs)
General: Slightly disheveled (mismatched buttons), pleasant but less engaged
Neuro:
  - Alert, oriented to person only (did not know place, date, or season)
  - Speech: More hesitant, circumlocutory
  - Attention: Cannot spell WORLD backwards at all
  - Memory: 0/3 objects at 5 minutes, did not recall task
  - Language: Word-finding difficulty increased, paraphasic errors
  - Visuospatial: Clock draw 1/5 (very disorganized)
  - Gait: Slightly shuffling (new finding)
  - No tremor at rest

MoCA today: 12/30 (was 18/30 six months ago) - SIGNIFICANT DECLINE

Assessment/Plan:
1. Alzheimer's Disease - PROGRESSING TO MODERATE STAGE. MoCA dropped from 18 to
   12 in 6 months - faster than expected. New neuropsychiatric symptoms (paranoia,
   irritability). New functional decline (incontinence, dressing difficulty).
   New gait changes concerning.
   - Given rapid decline, must rule out other causes:
     * ORDER MRI brain with contrast - rule out stroke, NPH, subdural
     * Labs: CBC, CMP, B12, TSH, UA (r/o UTI as cause of delirium)
     * RPR if not done
   - Continue current dementia medications at full dose
   - For behavioral symptoms: Start low-dose risperidone 0.25mg QHS - discuss
     black box warning for mortality in elderly dementia. Benefits vs risks
     explained to wife.

2. Caregiver burnout - MAJOR CONCERN. Wife is exhausted and tearful. Strongly
   encouraged in-home caregiver support. Provided social work referral. Discussed
   adult day programs. Wife agreed to explore options.

3. Incontinence - new. Check UA. May need urology consult if not infection.

4. Weight loss - 3 lbs in 6 months. Appetite affected? Ensure adequate nutrition.
   Consider dietary consult.

5. Gait change - shuffling concerning. If MRI unremarkable, consider Lewy body
   pathology contribution. No tremor or REM sleep behavior disorder per wife.

6. Safety - Increased supervision needed. Discussed that patient should never be
   left alone. Consider GPS tracking device.

7. DM2, HTN, HLD - continue current regimen.

Called wife this evening to check in. She found local support group meeting
tomorrow and will attend. Social work to follow up this week.

RTC 4-6 weeks after MRI completed, sooner if acute changes.
