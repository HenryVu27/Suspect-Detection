Patient: Patricia O'Brien    DOB: 07/18/1965    MRN: 34567123
Date: 2024-09-25       Provider: Dr. Sandra Kim, MD (Rheumatology)

Chief Complaint: RA follow-up, anemia follow-up

Subjective:
Pt returns for routine follow-up. RA continues well-controlled. Successfully
tapered prednisone to 3mg daily. Morning stiffness minimal - about 10 minutes.

"Feeling better since the iron infusions." Had 3 iron infusions over summer after
iron deficiency confirmed. Energy improved. GI workup negative - EGD and colonoscopy
unremarkable per GI notes.

Fingertip numbness persists - maybe slightly worse. Now waking at night with
numbness in both hands. Has to shake hands to get feeling back. "Probably need
to see about carpal tunnel."

Noticed some dry eyes lately - using over-the-counter drops. Mouth feels dry too
sometimes. "Probably just aging."

Blood sugars improved with weight loss - now running 110-120s fasting.

Current Medications:
- Methotrexate 20mg weekly (with folic acid 1mg daily)
- Adalimumab 40mg SQ every 2 weeks
- Prednisone 3mg daily
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Omeprazole 20mg daily

Assessment/Plan:
1. Rheumatoid Arthritis - excellent disease control. Continue current regimen.
   Prednisone now 3mg - continue slow taper.
2. Iron deficiency anemia - resolved with infusions. Continue oral iron. Recheck
   CBC in 3 months.
3. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome - clinical diagnosis. Refer to hand surgery
   for EMG/NCS and possible intervention.
4. Dry eyes/dry mouth - NEW CONCERN. In patient with seropositive RA, must consider
   secondary Sjogren's syndrome. Order SSA/SSB antibodies, Schirmer test. May need
   ophthalmology referral.
5. Type 2 DM - HbA1c improved to 6.8% with weight loss. Excellent.
6. Osteoporosis - DEXA ordered today.

RTC 3 months. Pending Sjogren's workup.
