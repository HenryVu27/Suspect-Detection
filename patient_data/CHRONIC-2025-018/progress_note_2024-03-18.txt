Patient: Patricia O'Brien    DOB: 07/18/1965    MRN: 34567123
Date: 2024-03-18       Provider: Dr. Sandra Kim, MD (Rheumatology)

Chief Complaint: RA follow-up, medication management

Subjective:
58 yo F with seropositive RA since 2015 here for routine follow-up. Reports good
disease control overall. Morning stiffness about 15 minutes - improved from before.
Occasional mild flares in hands with weather changes but manageable.

No new joint swelling or warmth. Able to do daily activities without difficulty.
Working as elementary school teacher, no missed days due to RA this year.

Tolerating methotrexate well. No mouth sores, no hair loss. Adalimumab injections
going well - husband helps with thigh injections.

Reports increased fatigue lately - "more tired than usual." Attributes to busy
schedule but wonders if anemia related.

Also notes some numbness in fingertips bilaterally - occasional, mostly at night.
"Probably sleeping on my hands wrong."

GERD controlled. Blood sugars running 120-140s fasting per home monitoring.

Current Medications:
- Methotrexate 20mg weekly (with folic acid 1mg daily)
- Adalimumab 40mg SQ every 2 weeks
- Prednisone 5mg daily
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Calcium/Vitamin D 600/400 BID

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/78, HR 72, Wt 158 lbs
General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
Hands: No synovitis, minimal bony enlargement DIPs/PIPs bilaterally, grip strength
       symmetric and normal
Wrists: No swelling or tenderness, full ROM
Elbows: No nodules, full extension
Knees: Left TKA well-healed, right - small effusion, no warmth
Feet: No synovitis, mild hallux valgus bilaterally

Labs from last week:
- CBC: Hgb 10.8 (L), MCV 78 (L), WBC 5.2, Plt 245
- CMP: Normal except glucose 142
- CRP: 0.4 (normal)
- ESR: 18 (normal)
- LFTs: Normal
- HbA1c: 7.2%

Assessment/Plan:
1. Rheumatoid Arthritis - well-controlled on current biologic regimen. CRP/ESR
   normal. No active synovitis. Continue methotrexate and adalimumab. Attempt
   prednisone taper to 4mg next month.
2. Microcytic anemia - new finding. Hgb 10.8, MCV 78. Check iron studies, consider
   GI evaluation given chronic NSAID use history and omeprazole (malabsorption).
3. Fingertip numbness - likely carpal tunnel vs early RA neuropathy. Watch for now.
4. Type 2 DM - HbA1c 7.2%, at goal. Continue metformin.
5. Osteoporosis - continue alendronate. DEXA due this year.
6. Right knee effusion - mild, asymptomatic. Monitor.

RTC 3 months. Labs in 6 weeks to recheck CBC.
