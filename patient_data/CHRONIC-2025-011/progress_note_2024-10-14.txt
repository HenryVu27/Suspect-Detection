PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Barbara Jackson    DOB: 06/18/1958    MRN: 45678234
Date: 2024-10-14       Provider: Dr. William Carter, MD

Chief Complaint: CKD follow-up

Subjective:
66 yo F with CKD Stage 3b returns for follow-up. Started empagliflozin and
chlorthalidone in March. Reports feeling "much better" on new regimen. BP at home
now running 125-135/75-82 - much improved.

Had some urinary frequency when started empagliflozin - "peeing a lot more" - but
adjusted. No yeast infections. Denies dizziness or dehydration symptoms.

Watching salt intake more carefully. Avoiding pickles and chips.

No swelling, no SOB, no nausea. Energy good.

Asking about seeing a kidney specialist - "Am I going to need dialysis someday?"

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Chlorthalidone 12.5mg daily
- Empagliflozin 10mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Atorvastatin 20mg QHS
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/78, HR 70, RR 14, Wt 168 lbs (-4), BMI 27.9
General: Well-appearing
CV: RRR
Ext: No edema

Labs from 10/07:
- Cr: 1.35 (stable), eGFR 46
- K: 4.5
- A1c: 6.8% (improved!)
- Urine ACR: 55 mg/g (improved from 85!)
- Hgb: 12.0 (improved)
- Iron studies: Ferritin 85, TIBC normal - adequate iron stores

Assessment/Plan:
1. CKD Stage 3b - eGFR 46, STABLE since starting SGLT2i and better BP control!
   ACR improved from 85 to 55. This is excellent - SGLT2i providing renal protection.
   Continue empagliflozin. Continue ACEi.
2. Hypertension - NOW AT GOAL! BP 128/78 today, home readings consistent. Addition
   of chlorthalidone was key. Continue current regimen.
3. Type 2 Diabetes - A1c 6.8%, improved on empagliflozin. Excellent control.
   Continue metformin (still appropriate at eGFR 46).
4. Anemia - Hgb normalized at 12.0. Iron stores adequate. Continue monitoring.
5. Nephrology referral - discussed. Given current stability, can continue primary
   care management. Would refer if:
   - eGFR drops below 30
   - Rapid decline (>5 mL/min/year)
   - Difficult-to-control electrolytes or anemia
   - Patient preference
   Patient prefers to continue with me for now. Reassured that we caught this
   early and are managing well.

Weight loss of 4 lbs - partly SGLT2i effect (glycosuria, diuresis), partly diet.
Continue lifestyle efforts.

RTC 3-4 months. Stable and doing well.
