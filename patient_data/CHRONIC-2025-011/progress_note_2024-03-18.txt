PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Barbara Jackson    DOB: 06/18/1958    MRN: 45678234
Date: 2024-03-18       Provider: Dr. William Carter, MD

Chief Complaint: CKD follow-up, BP check

Subjective:
65 yo F with CKD Stage 3a secondary to longstanding HTN here for routine follow-up.
Reports feeling well overall. No swelling, no urinary symptoms, no nausea. Energy
adequate.

Taking medications as prescribed. Checking BP at home - running 145-155/85-90.
Knows it's not at goal. Admits salt intake "could be better" - loves pickles and
chips.

Diabetes stable. No hypoglycemia.

No new joint pains - avoiding NSAIDs as advised.

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Atorvastatin 20mg QHS
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 152/88, HR 74, RR 14, Wt 172 lbs (stable), BMI 28.6
General: Well-appearing
CV: RRR
Ext: No edema, pulses 2+

Labs from 03/11:
- Cr: 1.3 (stable), eGFR 48 (was 55 last year - declining)
- K: 4.8
- A1c: 7.1%
- Urine ACR: 85 mg/g (moderately increased albuminuria)
- CBC: Hgb 11.8 (slightly low)

Assessment/Plan:
1. CKD Stage 3a - eGFR has declined from 55 to 48 over past year. Now technically
   Stage 3b. Proteinuria present (ACR 85). Progression concerning.
   - Already on max dose ACEi
   - BP control critical but suboptimal
   - Consider adding SGLT2 inhibitor for renal protection. Discussed empagliflozin
     10mg - has CKD indication and would help both DM and kidney.
   - Starting empagliflozin 10mg daily
   - Low sodium diet reinforced (<2g/day)
2. Hypertension - NOT at goal despite 2 agents. Adding chlorthalidone 12.5mg daily.
   Target BP <130/80 given CKD and DM.
3. Type 2 Diabetes - A1c 7.1%, acceptable. SGLT2i will also help. Continue metformin
   (eGFR still >45).
4. Anemia - Hgb 11.8, early anemia of CKD. Check iron studies, B12, folate.
5. CKD education - discussed diet (low sodium, moderate protein), avoiding NSAIDs,
   avoiding contrast if possible.

Labs: iron studies, B12, folate
RTC 3 months with labs 1 week prior.
