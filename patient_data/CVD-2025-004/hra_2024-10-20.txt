ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)
================================================================================
"I'm doing well overall. My main focus is preventing diabetes since both my parents
have it and I had gestational diabetes with both of my pregnancies. I've been working
hard on my diet and exercise and I feel like it's paying off - I've lost some weight
and my doctor said my blood sugar numbers are improving.

I do worry sometimes about my family history of diabetes and heart disease. I try to
stay proactive with my health. I get my check-ups regularly and take my medications
as prescribed.

My occasional headaches are much better now that I'm managing stress better and
getting regular massages.

No other concerns at this time. I feel fortunate that I'm generally healthy and I
want to keep it that way!"
