COLONOSCOPY REPORT

Patient: Aiden Kowalski    DOB: 02/19/1992    MRN: 01234890
Procedure Date: 2024-10-10
Procedure: Colonoscopy with biopsies (surveillance for dysplasia)
Endoscopist: Dr. Maria Fernandez, MD
Anesthesia: Propofol (monitored anesthesia care)

================================================================================
INDICATION:
Ulcerative colitis (pancolitis) with primary sclerosing cholangitis - annual
surveillance colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening (HIGH RISK category)

================================================================================
PROCEDURE DETAILS:

Informed consent obtained. Excellent bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Prep Score 9).
Colonoscope advanced to cecum with photo documentation. Chromoendoscopy with
0.1% methylene blue applied for enhanced dysplasia detection.

================================================================================
FINDINGS:

RECTUM:
- Erythema, friability, loss of vascular pattern
- Petechial hemorrhages on contact
- Mayo score: 2

SIGMOID COLON:
- Active inflammation with erythema and erosions
- ***RAISED LESION at 25cm: 12mm, irregular borders, nodular surface***
  Non-polypoid, Paris classification 0-IIa+IIc
  Concerning for dysplasia - biopsied extensively
- Additional satellite lesion at 22cm: 6mm, similar appearance
- Mayo score: 2

DESCENDING COLON:
- Continuous inflammation, erythema, friability
- ***RAISED LESION at 45cm: 8mm, slightly raised, irregular***
  Paris classification 0-IIa
  Biopsied
- Mayo score: 2

TRANSVERSE COLON:
- Moderate erythema and friability
- No masses or polyps
- Mayo score: 1-2

ASCENDING COLON:
- Mild erythema, better preserved vascular pattern
- No masses
- Mayo score: 1

CECUM:
- Mild erythema only
- Appendiceal orifice normal
- Mayo score: 1

TERMINAL ILEUM:
- Intubated, normal appearing (no backwash ileitis)

================================================================================
BIOPSIES OBTAINED:

Surveillance biopsies (random, every 10cm):
- Rectum x 4
- Sigmoid 15cm x 4
- Sigmoid 25cm x 4 (around lesion)
- Descending 35cm x 4
- Descending 45cm x 4 (around lesion)
- Transverse 55cm x 4
- Transverse 70cm x 4
- Ascending 85cm x 4
- Cecum x 4

Targeted biopsies:
- Sigmoid lesion 25cm x 6 (extensive sampling)
- Sigmoid satellite lesion 22cm x 2
- Descending lesion 45cm x 4

Total: 44 biopsies

================================================================================
PATHOLOGY RESULTS (Reported 10/12/2024):

SIGMOID LESION 25cm:
- ***LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LGD)*** - confirmed on expert review
- Tubular architecture with nuclear hyperchromasia, stratification
- Raised lesion morphology (DALM - dysplasia-associated lesion or mass)

SIGMOID SATELLITE LESION 22cm:
- Inflammatory changes with reactive atypia
- No definite dysplasia

DESCENDING LESION 45cm:
- ***INDEFINITE FOR DYSPLASIA***
- Recommend close follow-up and rebiopsy

RANDOM SURVEILLANCE BIOPSIES:
- Active colitis throughout (rectum through ascending)
- No flat dysplasia identified
- No invasive carcinoma

================================================================================
IMPRESSION:

1. ***LOSS OF REMISSION: Active ulcerative colitis, Mayo score 2, involving
   rectum through transverse colon***
   - Previous colonoscopy (2022) showed Mayo 0 (remission)

2. ***LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA in raised sigmoid lesion (25cm)***
   - In patient with UC + PSC, this is HIGH-RISK finding
   - Lesion morphology (raised, irregular) concerning for DALM

3. ***SECOND LESION (descending 45cm) indefinite for dysplasia***
   - Cannot exclude dysplasia

4. Lesions not amenable to simple polypectomy due to inflammation and multifocal
   nature

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. URGENT COLORECTAL SURGERY REFERRAL - Given UC + PSC + LGD in raised lesion,
   strong consideration for proctocolectomy

2. If surgery declined/delayed, repeat colonoscopy in 3 months with attempted
   endoscopic mucosal resection if inflammation controlled

3. Address UC flare - optimize medical therapy

4. Multidisciplinary discussion recommended (IBD conference)
