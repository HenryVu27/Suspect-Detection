- Vedolizumab 300mg IV q8 weeks
- Ursodiol 500mg BID
- Iron polysaccharide 150mg daily
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

- CMP: Normal, ALT 32, AST 28, Alk phos 95
- CRP: 0.3 (normal)
- Fecal calprotectin: 45 (normal <50) - EXCELLENT
- Ferritin: 65 (improved from 12)
- Vitamin D: 42 (optimal)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Ulcerative Colitis - IN REMISSION! Clinical, biochemical (calprotectin 45,
   CRP 0.3), and likely endoscopic remission (colonoscopy due for confirmation).
   - Continue vedolizumab every 8 weeks - do not change what's working
   - Schedule surveillance colonoscopy (due - last was 2022)
   - Given PSC + pancolitis, needs annual surveillance colonoscopy for
     dysplasia screening

2. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis - stable. LFTs mildly elevated but stable.
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Annual MRCP due - order for 6 months
   - Annual surveillance colonoscopy (above) also for PSC-IBD cancer screening

3. Iron deficiency anemia - RESOLVED with infusions. Ferritin 65, Hgb 13.8.
   Continue oral iron for maintenance. May need periodic infusions if drops.

4. Vitamin D - optimal at 42. Continue supplementation.

5. Colorectal cancer risk - HIGH due to pancolitis + PSC. Emphasized importance
   of annual surveillance. Patient understands.

6. Bone health - on chronic therapy, history of steroids. DEXA ordered.

Patient doing exceptionally well. Continue current regimen.

RTC 3 months. Colonoscopy scheduling in process.
