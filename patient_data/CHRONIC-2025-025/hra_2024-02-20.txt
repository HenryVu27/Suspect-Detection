ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)

"I've had UC since I was 24. The first few years were rough - I was in and out
of the hospital, tried multiple medications that didn't work, lost weight, lost
jobs. It affected every part of my life.

Things turned around when I started vedolizumab two years ago. It's the first
medication that's actually put me in remission. I can eat without fear, I can
travel, I can work normally. I almost feel like a regular person.

The PSC diagnosis was scary. Having a second chronic disease that affects my
liver was a lot to process. But it's mild so far and the doctor is monitoring
it closely.

My biggest fear is colon cancer. My doctor told me that having UC + PSC puts
me at higher risk. I know I need colonoscopies every year for monitoring. It's
stressful but I'd rather catch something early than wait until it's too late.

I try not to let the disease define me. I'm more than just a UC patient.
I have a career, a partner, hobbies. I exercise regularly because it helps my
mental health and maybe my gut health too. I'm careful about diet but not
obsessive.

The one thing I wish is that people understood invisible illness better. When
I'm in remission, I look totally healthy. No one knows what I deal with unless
I tell them. During flares, I've had people not believe I was sick because I
'look fine.' It's frustrating."
