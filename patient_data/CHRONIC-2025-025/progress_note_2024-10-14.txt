PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Aiden Kowalski    DOB: 02/19/1992    MRN: 01234890
Date: 2024-10-14       Provider: Dr. Maria Fernandez, MD (Gastroenterology/IBD)

Chief Complaint: Surveillance colonoscopy results, concerning symptoms

Subjective:
Pt returns for surveillance colonoscopy results and discussion of new symptoms.

NEW SYMPTOMS over past 6 weeks:
- Increased stool frequency: Now 5-6/day (was 2-3)
- Blood in stool: Returned - streaks of blood on toilet paper and in bowl
- Nocturnal stools: Waking 1-2x/night to use bathroom (never had before)
- Mild crampy abdominal pain, especially before bowel movements
- Fatigue returning
- "I thought I was in remission. This feels like a flare starting."

Denies fever, weight loss, joint pain, eye symptoms.

Still getting vedolizumab infusions on schedule. No missed doses.

No recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts.

Current Medications:
- Vedolizumab 300mg IV q8 weeks (last infusion 10/02)
- Ursodiol 500mg BID
- Iron polysaccharide 150mg daily
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
- Calcium 600mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 122/78, HR 76, Wt 171 lbs (down 4 lbs)
General: Appears mildly fatigued
Abdomen: Soft, mild tenderness LLQ, no rebound, normoactive bowel sounds

COLONOSCOPY RESULTS (performed 10/10/2024):

Procedure findings:
- LOSS OF REMISSION: Active inflammation throughout colon
- Mayo endoscopic score: 2 (moderate disease) - was 0 in 2022
- Erythema, friability, and erosions from rectum to hepatic flexure
- Several areas of raised, irregular mucosa in sigmoid and descending colon

PATHOLOGY (critical findings):
- Sigmoid colon (raised lesion): ***LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LGD)***
- Descending colon (raised lesion): Indefinite for dysplasia
- Multiple random biopsies: Active colitis, no dysplasia

Labs today:
- CRP: 2.8 (elevated, was 0.3)
- Fecal calprotectin: 380 (elevated, was 45)
- Hgb: 11.8 (dropping, was 13.8)
- LFTs: ALT 45, AST 38, Alk phos 115 (all slightly up)

Assessment/Plan:
***CRITICAL FINDINGS - DUAL CONCERNS***

1. UC Flare - loss of remission on vedolizumab after 2 years. Secondary loss
   of response to biologic. Concerning biochemically and endoscopically.
   - Initiate bridge therapy with budesonide MMX 9mg daily
   - Stool studies: C. diff, culture, ova/parasites - must rule out infection
   - Consider therapy change if steroids needed long-term:
     * Ustekinumab (different mechanism)
     * Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor)
   - Discuss at IBD multidisciplinary conference

2. ***COLITIS-ASSOCIATED DYSPLASIA - LOW-GRADE*** - This is a major finding.
   In patient with pancolitis + PSC (highest risk category), LGD in a raised
   lesion is very concerning.
   - Options discussed extensively with patient:
     A) Repeat colonoscopy in 3-6 months with attempt at endoscopic resection
        if lesion is visible and appears resectable
     B) Colectomy - definitive treatment, eliminates cancer risk
   - URGENT colorectal surgery referral placed
   - Patient is understandably anxious. Discussed that PSC+UC+dysplasia puts
     him in highest risk category for colorectal cancer.
   - Patient wants to discuss with family before deciding on surgery

3. PSC - LFTs slightly up. Could be progression vs. related to inflammation.
   - Hepatology consult for co-management
   - Will need MRCP to assess for changes

4. Anemia returning - Hgb 11.8 (was 13.8). Likely due to active inflammation
   and blood loss. May need iron infusion again.

PATIENT COUNSELING:
- Explained the significance of dysplasia in his high-risk setting
- Discussed that while colectomy is major surgery, it eliminates both UC
  symptoms AND colorectal cancer risk (though PSC cancer risk remains)
- Emphasized that delay in addressing dysplasia can lead to cancer development
- Patient tearful but understanding. Will discuss with partner.

Urgent colorectal surgery consult this week.
Will call with stool study results.
RTC 2 weeks or sooner after surgery consultation.
