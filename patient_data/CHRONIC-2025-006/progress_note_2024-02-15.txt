PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Darnell Washington    DOB: 04/12/1968    MRN: 89123456
Date: 2024-02-15       Provider: Dr. Maria Santos, MD

Chief Complaint: Diabetes follow-up

Subjective:
56 yo M with long-standing T2DM on insulin here for routine follow-up. Reports
glucose "running high" - fasting 180-220, post-meal often over 300. Admits he's
been "stretching" his insulin to make it last longer.

When asked to clarify, patient states he lost his job 4 months ago and with it
his insurance. Has been paying out of pocket for medications. Lantus cost is
"impossible" - over $300/month. Has been using half his usual Lantus dose and
skipping Humalog doses at meals to make it last.

Also reports stopping his sertraline because "couldn't afford everything." Mood
has been low - "hard to care about anything when you can't afford to stay alive."
Denies SI.

Neuropathy symptoms worsening - burning in feet at night. Also notes intermittent
blurry vision. Last eye exam over a year ago.

Current Medications (per patient - not what's prescribed):
- Lantus 25 units QHS (prescribed 50 units - taking half)
- Humalog 10 units with meals (taking maybe 1-2x/day instead of 3x)
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS
- Gabapentin 300mg TID
- Allopurinol 300mg daily
- NOT taking: sertraline (stopped), CPAP (returned equipment)

Objective:
Vitals: BP 158/94, HR 88, RR 18, Wt 242 lbs (+8 lbs), BMI 36.2
General: Tired appearing, poor eye contact, affect flat
HEENT: Dry mucous membranes
CV: RRR
Lungs: Clear
Ext: 1+ pitting edema bilateral LE, right foot missing 2nd toe, no current ulcers,
     sensation markedly decreased bilateral feet
Psych: Flat affect, psychomotor slowing

Labs from 02/08:
- HbA1c: 11.2% (was 8.5%)
- Fasting glucose: 245
- Cr: 1.8 (up from 1.4), eGFR 38
- K: 5.4 (H)
- Urine ACR: 320 mg/g

Assessment/Plan:
CRITICAL CONCERN: Patient is rationing insulin due to inability to afford medications.
This is a medical emergency - DKA risk is high.

1. Type 2 Diabetes - POORLY CONTROLLED, A1c 11.2%. Insulin rationing identified.
   ACTION TAKEN:
   - Provided samples of Lantus from office supply
   - Enrolled in Lantus patient assistance program (application submitted today)
   - Switched Humalog to Novolog (manufacturer assistance available)
   - Social work consulted for Medicaid application
   - Glucose log provided, ketone strips given, education on DKA warning signs
2. CKD - worsening, eGFR now 38 (was 45). Stage 3b. Hyperkalemia developing.
   Defer ACE increase given K 5.4. Nephrology referral placed.
3. Depression - OFF MEDICATIONS. PHQ-9 today: 18 (moderately severe). Started on
   fluoxetine (generic, $4 list). Crisis resources provided. Patient denies SI
   but feels hopeless about situation.
4. HTN - not controlled. Adding HCTZ would help BP and K but need to be careful
   with diuretics in CKD. Will defer until nephrology input.
5. Neuropathy - gabapentin can continue. Symptomatic worsening likely from poor
   glucose control.
6. Diabetic retinopathy - OVERDUE for eye exam. Urgent ophthalmology referral.
7. OSA - not treating. Will need to address once stability achieved.

SOCIAL WORK URGENT REFERRAL for:
- Medicaid application
- Medication assistance programs
- Food insecurity screening
- Transportation assistance

RTC 2 weeks or sooner if any signs of DKA. Patient verbalized understanding.
