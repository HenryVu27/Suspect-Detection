Chief Complaint: Urgent follow-up, insulin rationing

Subjective:
Pt returns as scheduled. Reports Medicaid application approved! Will be effective
03/15. In meantime, patient assistance programs have provided insulin. Now taking
full prescribed doses of Lantus and Novolog.

Glucose readings improved - fasting 140-180, post-meal 180-220. No episodes of
severe hypoglycemia. No signs of DKA.

Mood "a little better" - started fluoxetine 2 weeks ago. Still low energy but
less hopeless. Getting out of bed. Daughter has been helping with meals.

Saw ophthalmology - "they said my eyes are worse, need injections."

Current Medications (now taking as prescribed):
- Lantus 50 units QHS
- Novolog 15 units TID with meals
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS
- Gabapentin 300mg TID
- Allopurinol 300mg daily
- Fluoxetine 20mg daily (new)

Objective:
Vitals: BP 148/88, HR 82, Wt 240 lbs (-2), SpO2 96% RA
General: Better affect, more engaged
Ext: Trace edema, feet unchanged

No new labs - will check once Medicaid active

Assessment/Plan:
1. T2DM - improving now that on full insulin doses. Continue current regimen.
   A1c in 4-6 weeks to assess trajectory.
2. Diabetic retinopathy - progressed to severe NPDR per ophthalmology. Starting
   intravitreal injections. NEW DIAGNOSIS: Severe nonproliferative diabetic
   retinopathy (E11.349).
3. CKD Stage 3b - stable. Nephrology appointment scheduled 03/20.
4. Depression - some improvement on fluoxetine. Continue. F/u with psychiatry
   would be ideal but access limited.
5. HTN - improved but still elevated. Will discuss diuretic with nephrology.
6. Medicaid approved - can now access full benefits. Transition care to Medicaid
   primary care or continue here with new coverage.

Insurance enrollment assistance completed. Transportation assistance for appointments
arranged through Medicaid waiver.

RTC 4-6 weeks with labs.
