PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Darnell Washington    DOB: 04/12/1968    MRN: 89123456
Date: 2024-10-22       Provider: Dr. Maria Santos, MD

Chief Complaint: Chronic disease management

Subjective:
56 yo M returns for routine follow-up. "Doing okay, doc." Has been on Medicaid
since March, able to afford medications. Taking insulin as prescribed. Found
part-time work as security guard - "sitting job, not too hard on my feet."

Glucose readings at home: fasting 130-160, post-meal 160-200. Says he's been
"pretty good" with diet but admits fast food sometimes when working.

Mood improved - fluoxetine helpful. Sleeping better. Daughter moved in to help
which has improved his outlook.

Completed several rounds of eye injections - vision "about the same, not worse."
Saw nephrology - "they want to keep watching my kidneys."

Still not using CPAP. "I can't sleep with that thing on."

Feet have been okay - no new wounds. Sees podiatrist every 2 months.

Current Medications:
- Lantus 50 units QHS
- Novolog 15 units TID with meals
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- HCTZ 12.5mg daily (started by nephrology)
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS
- Gabapentin 300mg TID
- Allopurinol 300mg daily
- Fluoxetine 20mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/82, HR 76, Wt 235 lbs (-7 from Feb), BMI 35.2
General: Better spirits, engaged, smiles occasionally
CV: RRR
Ext: No edema, feet with chronic changes, no ulcers, sensation impaired

Labs from 10/15:
- HbA1c: 8.1% (down from 11.2%!)
- Fasting glucose: 152
- Cr: 1.6 (improved!), eGFR 44
- K: 4.4 (normalized with HCTZ)
- Urine ACR: 280 mg/g

Assessment/Plan:
1. T2DM - MUCH IMPROVED! A1c 8.1%, down from 11.2%. Still not at goal but significant
   progress. Continue current insulin. Goal A1c <8% given comorbidities and history.
   Consider adding SGLT2 inhibitor for renal protection though need to discuss with
   nephrology given CKD stage.
2. CKD Stage 3b - eGFR 44, slight improvement. K normalized. Proteinuria persists.
   Continue ACE/ARB at current dose. Nephrology to manage.
3. Severe NPDR - ongoing injections with ophthalmology. Vision stable.
4. Diabetic neuropathy - stable symptoms. Continue gabapentin.
5. Depression - remission on fluoxetine! Continue.
6. HTN - improved with HCTZ addition. At goal.
7. OSA - STILL UNTREATED. Encouraged CPAP use. Patient very resistant. Discussed
   risks including worsening HTN, cardiac events, daytime somnolence. Working as
   security guard, fatigue could be safety issue. Will try to arrange CPAP refit.
8. Weight - trending down with improved DM control. Encourage continued efforts.

RTC 3 months. Labs prior. Podiatry and ophthalmology continuing.
