PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Harold Peterson    DOB: 12/05/1950    MRN: 34567891
Date: 2024-03-15       Provider: Dr. Robert Kim, MD (Pulmonology)

Chief Complaint: Sleep study results, overlap syndrome

Subjective:
Pt returns to review sleep study and echocardiogram results. Symptoms unchanged -
fatigue, snoring, witnessed apneas. Leg swelling stable.

POLYSOMNOGRAM RESULTS (03/05/2024):
- Total sleep time: 5.8 hours
- Sleep efficiency: 72%
- AHI: 45 events/hour (SEVERE OSA)
- Lowest SpO2: 68%
- Mean SpO2: 84%
- Time SpO2 <88%: 3.2 hours
- Time SpO2 <80%: 45 minutes
- Predominant obstructive events
- REM-related worsening (AHI 72 in REM)
- Sleep architecture disrupted with reduced REM and slow-wave sleep

ECHOCARDIOGRAM (02/28/2024):
- LV EF 55-60% (normal)
- Mild tricuspid regurgitation
- Estimated RVSP 48 mmHg (mildly elevated, suggesting pulmonary HTN)
- RV mildly dilated
- RA mildly dilated

Current Medications: unchanged

Objective:
Vitals: BP 145/90, HR 80, SpO2 90% RA
General: Obese, fatigued
Lungs: Decreased BS, end-exp wheezes
Ext: 2+ LE edema

Labs from 02/15:
- BNP: 285 pg/mL (elevated)
- A1c: 7.4%
- Hgb: 16.8 (elevated - polycythemia from chronic hypoxia)
- Hct: 50.2

Assessment/Plan:
1. OVERLAP SYNDROME CONFIRMED - Severe OSA (AHI 45) + COPD. This is a HIGH-RISK
   condition associated with increased mortality, pulmonary hypertension, and
   heart failure. Patient has significant nocturnal hypoxemia (SpO2 to 68%).
   - Initiate BiPAP (not CPAP) with supplemental O2 given COPD component
   - BiPAP ST mode at 14/8 with 2L O2, titrate per download data
   - Urgent DME setup
2. Early pulmonary hypertension/right heart strain - RVSP 48, mild RV/RA dilation,
   elevated BNP 285, TR. This is consequence of chronic hypoxemia. Should improve
   with BiPAP + O2 treatment.
3. Secondary polycythemia (Hgb 16.8, Hct 50.2) - from chronic hypoxemia. May need
   phlebotomy if persists after treatment. Avoid phlebotomy if possible.
4. COPD - stable. Continue Symbicort.
5. Type 2 Diabetes - A1c 7.4%, slightly above goal. Continue metformin. May add
   agent later.
6. PTSD - stable.

BiPAP ordered. Critical to ensure compliance. Follow-up in 4-6 weeks with download.
