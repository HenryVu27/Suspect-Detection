PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Harold Peterson    DOB: 12/05/1950    MRN: 34567891

Chief Complaint: Overlap syndrome follow-up

Subjective:
73 yo M with COPD-OSA overlap syndrome here for follow-up. Started BiPAP in April.
Initial struggles with mask fit and getting used to pressure. Now using BiPAP ST
with 2L O2 every night.

BiPAP download data reviewed:
- Average use: 7.2 hours/night (excellent!)
- Residual AHI: 4.2 (controlled)
- Mean leak: acceptable
- 90% pressure 16/10 cmH2O

Reports feeling "much better than last year." Energy improved significantly. Wife
says snoring resolved, no more apneas. Morning headaches gone. Leg swelling improved.
Can walk further before getting winded - now doing 1/2 mile.

Denies CP, syncope. Mood stable - PTSD symptoms unchanged, well controlled.

Current Medications:
- Symbicort 160/4.5 2 puffs BID
- Albuterol HFA PRN (using 1x/day or less)
- BiPAP ST with O2 2L nightly
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- HCTZ 25mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS
- Tamsulosin 0.4mg QHS
- Sertraline 100mg daily
- ASA 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 132/78, HR 74, RR 16, Wt 242 lbs (-6), BMI 34.3, SpO2 94% RA (improved!)
General: Appears more alert, less fatigued than prior visits
Lungs: Decreased BS, minimal wheezes
CV: RRR
Ext: Trace LE edema (much improved!)

Labs from 10/10:
- BNP: 125 pg/mL (down from 285!)
- Hgb: 15.5 (normalizing)
- Hct: 46.2 (normalizing)
- A1c: 7.1%

PFTs (performed 10/15):
- FEV1: 1.58 L (62% predicted, improved from 58%!)
- FEV1/FVC: 0.58
- DLCO: 55% predicted

Assessment/Plan:
1. COPD-OSA overlap syndrome - EXCELLENT RESPONSE to BiPAP therapy! Compliance
   superb. AHI well controlled. Symptoms dramatically improved.
   - Continue BiPAP ST 14/10 with O2 2L
   - Daytime SpO2 improved to 94% (was 91%)
2. Pulmonary hypertension/RV strain - BNP normalized (125, was 285). Edema resolved.
   Treatment of hypoxemia has improved hemodynamics. Consider repeat echo in 6 months.
3. Secondary polycythemia - RESOLVING! Hgb 15.5, Hct 46.2 (was 16.8/50.2). No
   phlebotomy needed.
4. COPD - stable, actually slight improvement in FEV1 (62%, was 58%). Better sleep
   and oxygenation likely contributing.
5. Type 2 Diabetes - A1c 7.1%, improved. Continue metformin.
6. HTN - improved on current regimen with OSA treatment.
7. PTSD - stable. Continue sertraline.

This case demonstrates the critical importance of recognizing and treating overlap
syndrome. Patient had significantly improved outcomes with BiPAP + O2 therapy.

RTC 4 months. Continue excellent BiPAP compliance.
