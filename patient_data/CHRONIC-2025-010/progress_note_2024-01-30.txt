PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Harold Peterson    DOB: 12/05/1950    MRN: 34567891
Date: 2024-01-30       Provider: Dr. Robert Kim, MD (Pulmonology)

Chief Complaint: COPD follow-up, worsening fatigue

Subjective:
73 yo M Vietnam veteran with moderate COPD here for routine pulmonology follow-up.
Reports SOB stable - can walk about 1/4 mile before needing to rest. Using rescue
inhaler 2-3x/day. No exacerbations since February 2023.

However, reports significant fatigue over past 6 months that's different from his
usual COPD tiredness. "I just have no energy, even when I'm not short of breath."
Wife reports he falls asleep watching TV every evening. Snoring has gotten much
worse. She's noticed he "stops breathing then gasps" at night - happening multiple
times per hour. Wakes with headaches.

Diabetes stable. Taking medications. No chest pain. Leg swelling slightly worse.

Remains tobacco-free since 2016.

Current Medications:
- Symbicort 160/4.5 2 puffs BID
- Albuterol HFA PRN
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- HCTZ 25mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS
- Tamsulosin 0.4mg QHS
- Sertraline 100mg daily
- ASA 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 142/88, HR 82, RR 18, Temp 98.2F, Wt 248 lbs (+5), BMI 35.2, SpO2 91% RA
       Neck circumference 19 inches
General: Obese male, appears fatigued, speaking in full sentences
HEENT: Crowded oropharynx, Mallampati IV
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds, scattered wheezes, prolonged expiration
CV: RRR, distant heart sounds
Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilateral LE (worse than last visit)

Assessment/Plan:
1. COPD moderate (GOLD II) - stable from respiratory standpoint, no exacerbations.
   Continue current inhalers.
2. SUSPECT OVERLAP SYNDROME (COPD + OSA) - patient has classic OSA symptoms
   (snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime somnolence, morning HA) on top of COPD.
   This is a HIGH-RISK combination with increased mortality. Will order in-lab
   polysomnogram (not HST given COPD - need full evaluation).
3. Worsening leg edema + daytime fatigue - may indicate developing cor pulmonale
   or right heart failure from chronic hypoxemia. Will check BNP, consider echo.
4. Diabetes - continue metformin. Check A1c.
5. HTN - not controlled. May improve with OSA treatment.
6. PTSD - stable. Continue sertraline.

Labs ordered: BNP, CBC, BMP, A1c
Echo ordered
Sleep study ordered (in-lab PSG)

RTC after sleep study results. This is concerning for overlap syndrome which
carries significant morbidity/mortality risk.
