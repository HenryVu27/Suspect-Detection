INTERPRETATION

FINDINGS:
1. SEVERE Obstructive Sleep Apnea with AHI of 45.2 events/hour
2. CRITICAL nocturnal hypoxemia with minimum SpO2 of 68%, mean SpO2 84%,
   and 70% of sleep time with SpO2 <90%
3. Significant REM-predominant OSA (AHI 72 in REM)
4. Baseline hypoxemia (SpO2 92% awake) consistent with underlying COPD
5. Poor sleep architecture with reduced slow-wave and REM sleep
6. Elevated arousal index (48/hr) due to respiratory events

DIAGNOSIS: OVERLAP SYNDROME (Obstructive Sleep Apnea + COPD)

SEVERITY: Severe - this is a HIGH-RISK condition

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS

1. BiPAP ST therapy is STRONGLY recommended (not CPAP due to COPD and severe
   hypoxemia). Starting pressures suggested: IPAP 14 cmH2O, EPAP 8 cmH2O.
2. SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN with PAP therapy - start at 2L via BiPAP
3. Follow-up with download data and reassessment in 4-6 weeks
4. Consider formal CPAP titration study if not responding adequately
5. Evaluate for pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale given degree of
   nocturnal hypoxemia
6. Optimize COPD management
7. Weight loss counseling - even modest weight loss may improve OSA
8. Avoid sedatives, alcohol, and supine sleep position

CRITICAL: Overlap syndrome carries significantly increased cardiovascular
mortality compared to COPD or OSA alone. Treatment is urgent.
