PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Aisha Hassan    DOB: 07/28/1982    MRN: 78912345
Date: 2024-06-20       Provider: Dr. Lisa Wong, MD (Endocrinology)

Chief Complaint: Preconception planning, Graves' disease

Subjective:
Patient returns to discuss pregnancy planning. She and husband have decided they
want to try to conceive in the next 6 months. Has done research on options.
Concerned about methimazole and birth defects. Interested in thyroidectomy as
"definitive solution."

Currently feeling well. No hyperthyroid symptoms. Taking medications regularly.
Last menstrual period 06/10.

Current Medications:
- Methimazole 10mg daily
- Metoprolol 25mg BID
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
- Prenatal vitamin (started)

Objective:
Vitals: BP 116/74, HR 72, Wt 143 lbs
Thyroid: Mildly enlarged, no nodules

Labs from 06/12:
- TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (normal)
- Free T4: 1.1 ng/dL (normal)
- TSI: still elevated but lower than baseline

Assessment/Plan:
1. Graves' disease - euthyroid, stable. Given pregnancy plans:
   - Discussed all options in detail:
     a) Continue methimazole through 1st trimester then switch to PTU -
        CANNOT use PTU due to prior hepatotoxicity
     b) Continue methimazole - associated with methimazole embryopathy
        (aplasia cutis, choanal atresia) - small risk but present
     c) Radioactive iodine - would need to delay pregnancy 6 months minimum
     d) Thyroidectomy - definitive, could conceive immediately after healing
   - Patient elects thyroidectomy given PTU allergy and desire for near-term pregnancy
   - Referred to endocrine surgery. Will need to remain euthyroid until surgery.
2. Afib - continue metoprolol through surgery. Cardiology clearance needed.
3. Started prenatal vitamins - good.

Referral to Dr. Anderson (Endocrine Surgery) placed. Cardiology clearance requested.
