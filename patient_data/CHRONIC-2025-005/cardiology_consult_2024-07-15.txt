CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION

Patient: Aisha Hassan    DOB: 07/28/1982    MRN: 78912345
Date of Service: 2024-07-15
Referring Provider: Dr. Lisa Wong (Endocrinology)
Consulting Provider: Dr. James Miller, MD, FACC

================================================================================
REASON FOR CONSULTATION

Pre-surgical cardiac clearance for thyroidectomy. History of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation in setting of hyperthyroidism.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

42 yo F with Graves' disease diagnosed March 2022. Initial presentation included
palpitations, and she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR. She was
admitted for thyroid storm triggered by URI. Since achieving euthyroid state on
methimazole, she has had no AFib recurrence. She is on metoprolol 25mg BID for
rate control.

Now planning total thyroidectomy for pregnancy planning (allergic to PTU, wants
definitive treatment). Referred for surgical clearance.

Denies palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or near-syncope. Exercise
tolerance good - does yoga and walking without symptoms.

================================================================================
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

- Graves' disease
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (March 2022, no episodes since euthyroid)
- Anxiety disorder
- IBS-D

================================================================================
MEDICATIONS

- Methimazole 10mg daily
- Metoprolol succinate 25mg BID
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

================================================================================
ALLERGIES

PTU - hepatotoxicity

================================================================================
SOCIAL HISTORY

Non-smoker. Rare alcohol. Software engineer. Married, planning pregnancy.

================================================================================
FAMILY HISTORY

Father - MI at age 58
Mother - RA
No sudden cardiac death

================================================================================
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Vitals: BP 116/72, HR 68 regular, RR 14
General: Well-appearing female in no distress
CV: RRR, S1 S2 normal, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs
Lungs: Clear
Ext: No edema, pulses 2+ throughout
Neck: Mild thyromegaly, no JVD

================================================================================
DIAGNOSTICS REVIEWED

ECG (today): Normal sinus rhythm, HR 68, normal axis, no ST changes
Echocardiogram (2022): Normal LV function EF 60%, no structural abnormalities,
                       LA mildly dilated at time (likely due to AFib/hyperthyroid)
Holter monitor (2023): Sinus rhythm throughout, no arrhythmias

================================================================================
IMPRESSION

1. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - likely thyrotoxic, no recurrence since 2022
   when euthyroid achieved
2. Graves' disease - euthyroid on methimazole
3. Planning thyroidectomy for pregnancy planning

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS

1. CARDIAC CLEARANCE GRANTED for thyroidectomy - low surgical risk
2. Continue metoprolol through perioperative period for rate control during
   potential thyroid manipulation
3. Post-operatively, once confirmed hypothyroid and stable on levothyroxine,
   can consider weaning off metoprolol. If AFib was solely thyroid-induced,
   may not need long-term rate control.
4. CHA2DS2-VASc score = 1 (female). No anticoagulation indicated currently.
5. Repeat ECG post-operatively, consider Holter if any palpitations
6. Follow-up with cardiology in 2-3 months post-surgery
