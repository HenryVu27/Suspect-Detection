ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)

"My main focus right now is getting my thyroid situation resolved so I can start
a family. I've had Graves' disease for about 2 years and the medication has
controlled it but I'm allergic to one of the medications and the other one has
risks during pregnancy. So I'm having surgery later this month.

I'm a little nervous about the surgery but my doctors have been great at explaining
everything. I've also been doing well with my anxiety - the buspirone helps and
my therapist taught me good coping techniques.

I'm otherwise healthy and try to take good care of myself. My grandmother and aunt
both had thyroid issues so I guess it runs in my family."
