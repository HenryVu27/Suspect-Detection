PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Aisha Hassan    DOB: 07/28/1982    MRN: 78912345
Date: 2024-10-18       Provider: Dr. Lisa Wong, MD (Endocrinology)

Chief Complaint: Post-thyroidectomy follow-up

Subjective:
Patient s/p total thyroidectomy 09/25/2024 for Graves' disease (Dr. Anderson).
Surgery went well per operative note - no complications, parathyroids preserved.
Started levothyroxine 100mcg immediately post-op.

Reports feeling "okay" - some fatigue but improving. Voice returned to normal after
initial hoarseness. Taking levothyroxine every morning on empty stomach.

Eager to start trying to conceive. Last menstrual period 10/05. Wants to know if
thyroid replacement is optimized.

No palpitations since surgery. Cardiologist weaned metoprolol and stopped it last week.

Current Medications:
- Levothyroxine 100mcg daily
- Calcium carbonate 500mg TID (post-op for hypocalcemia risk)
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
- Prenatal vitamin

Objective:
Vitals: BP 114/72, HR 68 (NSR), Wt 145 lbs (+2)
Neck: Surgical scar healing well, no swelling
CV: RRR

Labs from 10/10 (2 weeks post-op):
- TSH: 4.8 mIU/L (slightly elevated)
- Free T4: 0.9 ng/dL (low normal)
- Calcium: 9.2 (normal)
- PTH: 35 pg/mL (normal)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Hypothyroidism, post-thyroidectomy - TSH 4.8 slightly elevated, Free T4 low normal.
   For pregnancy planning, want TSH <2.5. Increase levothyroxine to 112mcg daily.
   Recheck in 6 weeks.
2. Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism risk - calcium and PTH normal! Can taper calcium
   supplementation. Continue vitamin D.
3. Preconception - once TSH optimized (<2.5), can proceed with conception. Will need
   close monitoring during pregnancy - levothyroxine requirements typically increase.
4. History of paroxysmal AFib - no episodes since thyroidectomy. Off metoprolol.
   If hyperthyroidism was the trigger, may not recur.
5. Anxiety - stable on buspirone.

Recheck TSH/FT4 in 6 weeks. Once optimized, cleared to try to conceive.
