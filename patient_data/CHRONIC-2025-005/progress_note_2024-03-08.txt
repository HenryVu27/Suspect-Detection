Chief Complaint: Hyperthyroidism follow-up

42 yo F with Graves' disease here for routine follow-up. On methimazole 10mg daily.
Reports feeling "pretty good" - better than a year ago. Weight stable, no more
palpitations. Heart racing episodes resolved. No tremor. Energy good.

Occasional loose stools but attributes to IBS which she's had for years. Denies
heat intolerance, excessive sweating. Sleep okay. Mood stable - anxiety improved
since thyroid controlled.

Plans to get pregnant in next year - wants to discuss implications for treatment.

Current Medications:
- Methimazole 10mg daily
- Metoprolol 25mg BID
- Buspirone 10mg BID
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily

Assessment/Plan:
1. Graves' disease - euthyroid on methimazole 10mg. Well controlled for past 8 months.
   Continue current dose.
2. Atrial fibrillation - no episodes since thyroid controlled. Will defer to cardiology
   regarding continuing rate control. May be able to wean off metoprolol.
3. Preconception counseling - discussed Graves' and pregnancy. Options include:
   - Continue methimazole (risks of birth defects in 1st trimester)
   - Radioactive iodine ablation (must delay pregnancy 6 months after)
   - Thyroidectomy (definitive treatment, would need replacement therapy)
   Patient wants to discuss with husband. Will schedule dedicated visit to plan.
4. Anxiety - stable on buspirone. Continue.

RTC 3 months. Consider preconception planning visit.
