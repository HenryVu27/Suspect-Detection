Assessment/Plan:
1. Geriatric wellness - 83 yo with high comorbidity burden but maintaining
   function and independence. DISCUSS goals of care, advance directives
   (completed - daughter is healthcare proxy).

2. Polypharmacy - 12 medications, high pill burden. Reviewed for interactions
   and appropriateness. Consider deprescribing famotidine (no clear ongoing
   indication noted). Otherwise medications appropriate for conditions.

3. Atrial Fibrillation - rate-controlled on metoprolol. Continue apixaban
   (CHA2DS2-VASc 6, high stroke risk).

4. Hypertension - BP 142/78, reasonable for age. Avoid overtreatment given
   fall risk. Continue current regimen.

5. Type 2 DM - HbA1c 7.6%, acceptable for age/comorbidities. Avoid hypoglycemia
   (fall risk). Continue glipizide and sitagliptin.

6. CKD Stage 3b - stable eGFR 42. Continue monitoring.

9. Mild Cognitive Impairment - MoCA 24/30, mild impairment. Monitor. Not
   recommending cholinesterase inhibitor at this time.

10. Fall risk - HIGH. Walker use, home safety, vitamin D adequate. Continue
    PT as needed.

11. Social - Living alone but with support (aide, daughter). Screen for
    depression - PHQ-2 negative today.

Continue current regimen. Update vaccinations (flu, COVID, pneumonia done).
