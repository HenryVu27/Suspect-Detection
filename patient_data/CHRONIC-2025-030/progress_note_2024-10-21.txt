PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Eleanor Patterson    DOB: 08/05/1940    MRN: 56789345
Date: 2024-10-21       Provider: Dr. William Harris, MD (Geriatric Medicine)

Chief Complaint: Daughter concerned about confusion and decline

Subjective:
Pt brought in by daughter Susan with concerns about cognitive and functional
decline over past 2 months.

Per daughter:
- Confusion: "She's not herself. Gets confused about the day, asks the same
  questions over and over. Couldn't remember my son's name last week."
- Getting lost: "Found her wandering in the parking lot last week. She was
  looking for her apartment but was in the wrong building."
- Missed medications: "The aide found pill organizer not touched for 2 days.
  She forgot to take them."
- Declined cooking: "Burned a pot badly. Almost set off smoke alarm."
- Hygiene declining: "Not bathing even when aide comes. Wearing same clothes."
- Fall: Fell last week (no injury). "She said she tripped but I think she was
  confused about where she was."

Per patient: "I'm fine. Everyone worries too much." Doesn't recall falling or
getting lost. Becomes agitated when daughter describes concerns.

NEW SYMPTOM per daughter: "She's been complaining of a cough for a couple weeks.
Seemed tired and not eating well."

Medications: Uncertain adherence per above.

Vitals at home (daughter checked): Felt warm yesterday.

Current Medications: (Same as last visit)

Objective:
Vitals: BP 118/70 (lower than baseline), HR 98 irregular, Temp 100.4°F, RR 22,
        O2 sat 93% RA (low), Wt 132 lbs (down 6 lbs)
General: Appears tired, slightly unkempt, intermittently drowsy
Cardiac: Irregularly irregular, tachycardic
Lungs: Crackles right base, decreased breath sounds right lower lobe
Abdomen: Soft
Neuro: Alert but disoriented - knows name, thinks year is 2020, doesn't know
       where she is ("the hospital?"). Unable to complete MoCA today.
Skin: No rash, dry mucous membranes

Labs (STAT today):
- CBC: WBC 14.8 (elevated), Hgb 10.8, Plt 148
- CMP: Na 148 (HIGH - dehydration), K 3.8, Cr 2.1 (UP from 1.4), BUN 45,
       glucose 220
- Urinalysis: Trace protein, no WBC, no bacteria
- Procalcitonin: 0.8 (elevated - bacterial infection likely)
- Lactate: 2.2

CXR:
- Right lower lobe consolidation
- No pleural effusion
- Consistent with pneumonia

Assessment/Plan:
***ACUTE ILLNESS WITH DELIRIUM - REQUIRES HOSPITALIZATION***

1. DELIRIUM - superimposed on possible baseline MCI. Acute cognitive decline
   with fluctuating attention, disorientation. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
   - Infection (pneumonia)
   - Dehydration (Na 148)
   - Possible medication nonadherence (missed doses, possible missed anticoagulation)
   - UTI ruled out

2. COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA - Right lower lobe consolidation, elevated WBC,
   fever, tachycardia, hypoxia.
   - ADMIT to hospital
   - Antibiotics: Ceftriaxone + azithromycin per CAP guidelines
   - Oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - Watch for aspiration component given cognitive state

3. DEHYDRATION/ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY - Na 148, Cr 2.1 (baseline 1.4). Prerenal
   from poor intake.
   - IV fluids cautiously (afib, prior cardiac history)
   - Monitor I/O

4. HYPERGLYCEMIA - Glucose 220. Infection-related. Likely missed diabetes
   medications.
   - Insulin sliding scale while inpatient
   - Hold oral agents until stabilized

5. POSSIBLE MISSED ANTICOAGULATION - HIGH CONCERN given afib and high stroke
   risk. Cannot confirm recent apixaban adherence.
   - Check no signs of CVA (no focal deficits currently but delirium makes
     exam difficult)
   - Resume anticoagulation once able to take PO reliably
   - Consider bridging with heparin if extended NPO status

6. FALLS - Fell last week. Fall in setting of undiagnosed pneumonia and
   confusion. High risk.

7. FUNCTIONAL/COGNITIVE BASELINE - Need to reassess after acute illness resolves.
   Daughter notes decline over 2 months - may have been brewing infection or
   may represent true dementia progression. Consider formal neuropsych testing
   after recovery.

8. GOALS OF CARE DISCUSSION - Spoke with daughter. Patient has advance directive
   (full code currently). Given trajectory, should revisit goals after acute
   illness resolves. May need to discuss transition to higher level of care
   (assisted living vs. memory care).

9. SOCIAL - Lives alone, clearly not safe at present. Discharge planning will
   need to address - likely cannot return to independent living safely.

ADMISSION to medicine service. Called daughter with plan. Will update daily.
