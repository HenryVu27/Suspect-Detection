nephropathy.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

59 yo Vietnamese male with Type 2 Diabetes x 16 years complicated by CKD Stage 4
(eGFR 18), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (s/p laser), and diabetic neuropathy.
Referred for transplant evaluation.

CKD has been progressive:
- 2020: eGFR 45
- 2022: eGFR 28
- 2024: eGFR 18 (declining ~5 mL/min/year)

AV fistula placed August 2023 and is maturing well.

No prior transplants. Blood type: B positive.

================================================================================
MEDICAL HISTORY

1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with:
   - Diabetic nephropathy (CKD Stage 4)
   - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (s/p laser)
   - Diabetic neuropathy
2. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 4
3. Hypertension
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. Anemia of CKD (on darbepoetin)
6. Secondary hyperparathyroidism

================================================================================
SURGICAL HISTORY

- AV fistula creation 2023
- Bilateral retinal laser photocoagulation 2020

================================================================================
ALLERGIES

- Iodinated contrast (contrast-induced nephropathy)
- Lisinopril (angioedema)

================================================================================
SOCIAL HISTORY

- Former smoker, quit 2008
- No alcohol since kidney disease diagnosis
- Married, two adult children
- Son willing to be evaluated as potential living donor
- On disability, former restaurant owner

================================================================================
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Vitals: BP 138/82, HR 70, Wt 176 lbs
General: Pleasant, well-appearing male
CV: RRR, no murmurs
Lungs: Clear
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no surgical scars on abdomen
Ext: 1+ edema bilateral, left forearm AV fistula with good thrill/bruit
Neuro: Decreased sensation bilateral feet (neuropathy)

================================================================================
LABORATORY REVIEW

eGFR: 18 mL/min (CKD Stage 4)
A1c: 8.5%
Hgb: 10.2 (on ESA)
Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
PTH: 298 pg/mL
Hepatitis B: negative
Hepatitis C: negative
HIV: negative
CMV: positive (prior exposure)
EBV: positive (prior exposure)

================================================================================
CARDIAC EVALUATION

Stress echo (2024-05-28): No inducible ischemia, EF 55%
Risk: Intermediate given diabetes, acceptable for transplant

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT

59 yo M with ESKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy, appropriate candidate for
kidney transplant evaluation.

Favorable factors:
- Motivated patient with good family support
- Potential living donor (son)
- Adequate cardiac function
- No active infections or malignancy
- Adequate surgical abdomen

Concerns:
- Diabetes control needs optimization (A1c 8.5%)
- Will need close monitoring post-transplant for diabetic complications
- Contrast allergy limits certain studies

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS

1. APPROVE for kidney transplant waiting list
2. Add to deceased donor list - Blood type B, estimated wait 4-5 years in this region
3. Living donor evaluation for son - expedite given declining function
4. Optimize diabetes control - target A1c <8% pre-transplant if possible
5. Complete immunization update (Hepatitis B, Pneumovax, Shingrix)
6. Dental clearance
7. Continue current nephrology care with Dr. Chen
8. Transplant coordinator will provide education on listing process

Patient understands:
- Living donor transplant preferred if available
- May need dialysis bridge if function declines before transplant available
- Risks and benefits of transplantation discussed
- Immunosuppression requirements discussed
