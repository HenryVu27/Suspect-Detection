PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Nguyen Tran    DOB: 02/14/1965    MRN: 56789345

Chief Complaint: CKD management, approaching ESKD

Subjective:
59 yo M with CKD Stage 4/5 returns for follow-up. Labs show eGFR has declined to 15.
Discussing timing of dialysis initiation.

Reports new symptom: nausea in mornings, worse with certain foods. Appetite decreased
over past month - "Just not hungry like before." Lost about 5 lbs. Some metallic
taste occasionally. Energy level declining - tired by afternoon.

These are early uremic symptoms - discussed with patient that dialysis is approaching.

Completed transplant evaluation - LISTED for deceased donor kidney. Son is being
evaluated as potential living donor (awaiting results).

AV fistula continues to mature well. Vascular pleased with access.

Mood okay but anxious about dialysis. "I knew it was coming but still scary."

Current Medications:
- Lantus 45 units QHS
- Lispro 15 units TID with meals
- Losartan 50mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Carvedilol 12.5mg BID
- Rosuvastatin 40mg QHS
- Gabapentin 200mg BID (reduced for eGFR)
- Calcitriol 0.25mcg daily
- Calcium carbonate 1000mg TID
- Darbepoetin 60mcg SQ monthly (increased)
- Sevelamer 1600mg TID
- Sodium bicarbonate 1300mg TID
- ASA 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 148/86, HR 72, Wt 173 lbs (-5), BMI 27.0
General: Appears fatigued, mild pallor
CV: RRR, S4 present
Lungs: Clear
Ext: 1+ edema
Fistula: Excellent thrill and bruit, mature

Labs from 10/14:
- Cr: 4.2, eGFR 15 (now Stage 5)
- BUN: 68
- K: 5.3
- CO2: 18
- Calcium: 8.6
- Phosphorus: 5.8
- PTH: 342
- Hgb: 9.8 (despite EPO increase)
- A1c: 8.2%

Assessment/Plan:
1. CKD Stage 5 (ESKD) - eGFR 15, now Stage 5. Patient having uremic symptoms
   (nausea, anorexia, fatigue, metallic taste). These are indications for
   dialysis initiation. Discussed with patient:
   - Recommend starting dialysis within next 4-6 weeks
   - Access is ready - fistula mature
   - Will coordinate with dialysis center for training and scheduling
   - Continue to hope for living donor - son's evaluation pending
2. Metabolic acidosis - worsening (CO2 18). Dialysis will correct.
3. Secondary hyperparathyroidism - worsening (PTH 342, phos 5.8). Difficult to
   control without dialysis. Add cinacalcet 30mg daily.
4. Anemia of CKD - worsening despite EPO. Hgb 9.8. Iron studies show low ferritin.
   Add IV iron at dialysis initiation.
5. Type 2 Diabetes - A1c 8.2%, slightly improved. Insulin requirements may decrease
   on dialysis.
6. Hypertension - will likely improve with dialysis and volume removal.
7. Anxiety about dialysis - offered CKD education class and peer support. Will have
   social worker check in.

Dialysis center referral placed. Target start date within 6 weeks.
Transplant listing: continue on deceased donor list, living donor evaluation ongoing.
