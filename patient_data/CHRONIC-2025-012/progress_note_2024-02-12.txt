PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Nguyen Tran    DOB: 02/14/1965    MRN: 56789345
Date: 2024-02-12       Provider: Dr. David Chen, MD (Nephrology)

Chief Complaint: CKD Stage 4 management

Subjective:
58 yo M with advanced diabetic nephropathy here for routine nephrology follow-up.
eGFR has been slowly declining - now 20 (was 22 in October). Understanding that
dialysis is likely within next 1-2 years.

AV fistula placed last August is maturing well per vascular. Thrill and bruit present.
Glad he got it done early - "Want to be ready when the time comes."

No uremic symptoms currently - no nausea, no metallic taste, no severe fatigue.
Appetite okay. Some mild ankle swelling.

Taking medications but admits missing evening insulin doses occasionally - "I'm
tired by evening and sometimes forget."

Darbepoetin injection last month. Feeling okay energy-wise.

Current Medications:
- Lantus 45 units QHS
- Lispro 15 units TID with meals
- Losartan 50mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Carvedilol 12.5mg BID
- Rosuvastatin 40mg QHS
- Gabapentin 300mg BID (renally dosed)
- Calcitriol 0.25mcg daily
- Calcium carbonate 1000mg TID with meals
- Darbepoetin 40mcg SQ monthly
- Sevelamer 800mg TID with meals
- Sodium bicarbonate 650mg TID
- ASA 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 142/82, HR 68, RR 16, Wt 178 lbs (+3), BMI 27.8
General: Well-appearing, no pallor
CV: RRR
Lungs: Clear
Ext: 1+ edema bilateral ankles
Fistula: Left forearm - thrill palpable, bruit auscultated, no signs of infection

Labs from 02/05:
- Cr: 3.2 (up from 2.9), eGFR 20
- K: 5.1
- CO2: 20 (low, metabolic acidosis from CKD)
- Calcium: 8.8 (low normal)
- Phosphorus: 5.2 (H)
- PTH: 285 pg/mL (H)
- Hgb: 10.8
- A1c: 8.8% (H)

Assessment/Plan:
1. CKD Stage 4, progressing - eGFR 20, down from 22. Trajectory suggests dialysis
   likely within 12-18 months. AV fistula maturing well. Discussed modalities:
   - Referred to transplant clinic for evaluation (living donor preferred if family available)
   - Discussed hemodialysis vs peritoneal dialysis - patient prefers HD given fistula
   - Continue conservative management to delay as long as safely possible
2. Diabetic nephropathy - primary cause. BP control important. Losartan at 50mg,
   not maximized due to K and eGFR concerns.
3. Metabolic acidosis - bicarbonate low at 20. Increase sodium bicarbonate to 1300mg TID.
4. Secondary hyperparathyroidism - PTH 285, phosphorus 5.2. Increase sevelamer to
   1600mg TID with meals. Continue calcitriol.
5. Anemia of CKD - Hgb 10.8, stable. Continue darbepoetin monthly.
6. Type 2 Diabetes - A1c 8.8%, not at goal. Patient admits missing doses. Discussed
   importance of adherence. Consider simplifying regimen.
7. Hypertension - fair control. Continue current agents.
8. Edema - mild, likely volume from CKD. Watch salt intake. Could consider increasing
   furosemide (currently not on diuretic).

Transplant referral placed. RTC 6-8 weeks.
