Patient: Dorothy Chen    DOB: 02/28/1945    MRN: 45678234
Date: 2024-08-20       Provider: Dr. Michael Torres, MD (Endocrinology)

Chief Complaint: Osteoporosis management, romosozumab month 6

Subjective:
Pt returns for romosozumab follow-up. Has received 6 monthly injections at
infusion center without issues. "The nurses are wonderful."

Reports feeling "maybe a little stronger." No new falls. Back pain unchanged.
Continues chair yoga and daily walks with daughter.

Denies injection site reactions. No new symptoms.

Concerned about one thing: "I've been having some chest tightness when I walk up
stairs. Only started a few weeks ago. Goes away when I rest."

Also notes increased fatigue. "I thought it was just my age."

Appetite good. No weight changes.

Current Medications:
- Romosozumab 210mg monthly (at infusion center)
- Calcium carbonate 600mg BID
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
- Levothyroxine 75mcg daily
- Amlodipine 5mg daily
- Acetaminophen 650mg PRN

Objective:
Vitals: BP 142/82, HR 78, Wt 116 lbs
General: Pleasant, appears slightly fatigued
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, soft systolic murmur at aortic area (new?),
                no peripheral edema
Lungs: Clear bilaterally
Spine: Chronic kyphosis, no new tenderness

Labs:
- Calcium: 9.8 (normal)
- Creatinine: 1.1, eGFR: 52

Assessment/Plan:
1. Severe Osteoporosis on romosozumab - tolerating well, month 6 of 12. Will
   continue monthly injections. Repeat DEXA at end of treatment course.

2. NEW: Exertional chest tightness - CONCERNING in 79 yo. New systolic murmur
   noted. Given romosozumab cardiovascular warnings (increased CV event risk),
   this requires immediate workup.
   - URGENT: Order echocardiogram
   - Order stress test (pharmacologic given limited mobility)
   - Check BNP
   - May need to discuss romosozumab continuation if significant CV disease found
   - Instructed pt to go to ER if chest pain worsens or occurs at rest

3. Fatigue - could be cardiac-related. Will assess after cardiac workup. Check
   CBC, TSH, B12.

4. CKD Stage 3a - slightly worse eGFR 52. Monitor.

5. Hypertension - slightly elevated today 142/82. Recheck after cardiac workup.

IMPORTANT: Called cardiology directly - appointment scheduled in 1 week.
Explained warning signs to patient and daughter.

RTC 1 month for romosozumab OR sooner for cardiac results.
