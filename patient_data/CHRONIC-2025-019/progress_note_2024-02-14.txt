PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Dorothy Chen    DOB: 02/28/1945    MRN: 45678234
Date: 2024-02-14       Provider: Dr. Michael Torres, MD (Endocrinology)

Chief Complaint: Osteoporosis management, DEXA follow-up

Subjective:
79 yo F with severe osteoporosis (history of 2 vertebral compression fractures)
here for annual follow-up. Reports taking alendronate as directed - first thing
in morning, upright for 30 minutes, with full glass of water.

No new falls. Uses cane for outdoor walking. Home has been "fall-proofed" -
removed throw rugs, added grab bars. Daughter moved in last year to help.

Back pain stable - chronic from old fractures. Rates 3-4/10 most days. Uses
Tylenol as needed.

Exercising with chair yoga DVD at home. Walks around block with daughter daily
when weather permits. Stopped driving 6 months ago due to vision changes.

Eating well - daughter prepares meals. Taking calcium and vitamin D as directed.

Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations. Some constipation - "always
been that way."

Current Medications:
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Calcium carbonate 600mg BID
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
- Levothyroxine 75mcg daily
- Amlodipine 5mg daily
- Acetaminophen 650mg PRN

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/78, HR 68, Wt 118 lbs, Ht 5'0" (was 5'2" - height loss)
General: Pleasant elderly woman, kyphotic posture, ambulatory with cane
Spine: Kyphosis, tenderness T12-L2 region, no new point tenderness
Extremities: No edema, good distal pulses
Gait: Slow, cautious, stable with cane

DEXA Results (performed 02/10/2024):
- Lumbar spine T-score: -3.2 (was -3.0 in 2022) - WORSENING
- Femoral neck T-score: -2.9 (was -2.7 in 2022) - WORSENING
- Total hip T-score: -2.6 (was -2.5 in 2022) - WORSENING

Labs from last week:
- Calcium: 9.2, Phosphorus: 3.8
- Vitamin D, 25-OH: 42 (adequate)
- TSH: 0.8 (normal)
- Creatinine: 1.0, eGFR: 55
- CTX (bone resorption marker): 450 (elevated - poor response)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Severe Osteoporosis - CONCERNING: DEXA shows worsening despite 5+ years of
   alendronate. T-scores declining at all sites. CTX elevated suggesting
   inadequate suppression of bone resorption.
   - Bisphosphonate failure - need to transition to anabolic therapy
   - Recommend romosozumab (Evenity) 210mg monthly x 12 months, then transition
     to denosumab
   - Will need to check calcium levels regularly on romosozumab
   - Discuss with patient and daughter about injection therapy

2. Chronic back pain - stable, from old vertebral fractures. Continue Tylenol PRN.

3. Fall prevention - continue current measures. Refer to PT for balance assessment.

4. Vitamin D - level adequate at 42. Continue current supplementation.

5. Hypothyroidism - TSH normal. Continue levothyroxine 75mcg.

6. CKD Stage 3a - eGFR 55. Monitor, will affect medication choices.

Extensive discussion with patient and daughter about need to change osteoporosis
therapy. Patient initially resistant ("another medication?") but understands
fracture risk. Will proceed with romosozumab.

RTC 1 month after starting new therapy.
