Date of Study: 2024-08-28
Study Type: Diagnostic overnight polysomnography (in-lab)
Ordering Provider: Dr. Marcus Williams, MD
Interpreting Provider: Dr. Raymond Chen, MD (Sleep Medicine)

================================================================================
CLINICAL INDICATION
================================================================================
Excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring with witnessed apneas, morning headaches,
unrefreshing sleep. Known history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
diabetes. High clinical suspicion for obstructive sleep apnea.

Epworth Sleepiness Scale: 16/24 (significant daytime sleepiness)

================================================================================
STUDY CONDITIONS
================================================================================
Lights out: 22:15
Lights on: 05:45
Total recording time: 450 minutes
Total sleep time: 342 minutes
Sleep efficiency: 76% (low)
Sleep latency: 8 minutes (normal)
REM latency: 98 minutes (normal)

Sleep Architecture:
- Stage N1: 12% (increased)
- Stage N2: 65%
- Stage N3: 8% (reduced slow wave sleep)
- Stage REM: 15% (slightly reduced)

================================================================================
RESPIRATORY EVENTS
================================================================================
Total obstructive apneas: 156
Total central apneas: 8
Total mixed apneas: 12
Total hypopneas: 62

Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI): 42.0 events/hour (SEVERE)
- Supine AHI: 58.2 events/hour
- Non-supine AHI: 28.4 events/hour

Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI): 48.5 events/hour

Longest apnea duration: 52 seconds
Mean apnea duration: 24 seconds

Oxygen Saturation:
- Baseline SpO2: 94%
- Lowest SpO2: 72%
- Mean SpO2: 89%
- Time SpO2 <90%: 28% of total sleep time
- Time SpO2 <80%: 8% of total sleep time (significant)

================================================================================
CARDIAC MONITORING
================================================================================
- Underlying atrial fibrillation throughout study (known)
- Mean heart rate: 74 bpm (range 52-108 bpm)
- Frequent heart rate variations associated with respiratory events
- No significant arrhythmias beyond baseline AFib

================================================================================
LIMB MOVEMENTS
================================================================================
Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI): 8.2/hour (mildly elevated)
- Not clinically significant

================================================================================
SNORING
================================================================================
Snoring noted throughout the night, loudest in supine position
Snoring intensity: Severe (>60 dB recorded)

================================================================================
IMPRESSION
================================================================================
1. SEVERE OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (AHI 42)
   - Significant positional component (worse supine)
   - Associated with significant oxygen desaturation (nadir 72%)
   - Moderate sleep fragmentation

2. REDUCED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (76%)
   - Likely secondary to frequent arousals from respiratory events

3. SEVERE NOCTURNAL HYPOXEMIA
   - 28% of sleep time spent with SpO2 <90%
   - This is clinically significant and associated with increased
     cardiovascular risk, especially in patient with existing heart
     failure and atrial fibrillation

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
1. POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (PAP) THERAPY: Strongly recommended.
   Patient is candidate for CPAP titration study, or auto-titrating CPAP
   (APAP) with in-lab or home titration protocol.

2. Given severity and comorbidities, in-lab CPAP titration preferred to
   ensure adequate treatment and patient acclimation.

3. IMPORTANT CARDIOVASCULAR CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Untreated severe OSA significantly increases risk of:
     * Heart failure exacerbation
     * Atrial fibrillation burden
     * Stroke (especially important given patient on anticoagulation)
     * Uncontrolled hypertension
     * Worsening diabetes control
   - Treatment with CPAP may improve all of the above

4. WEIGHT LOSS: Obesity is a major contributor. Even modest weight loss
   (10%) can significantly reduce OSA severity.

5. POSITIONAL THERAPY: Sleep position training to avoid supine position
   may be helpful adjunct but is not sufficient as sole therapy given
   severity.

6. FOLLOW-UP: Recommend follow-up with sleep medicine after CPAP initiation
   to assess compliance, efficacy, and symptom improvement.

7. Recheck Epworth Sleepiness Scale after 4-6 weeks of treatment to assess
   response.
