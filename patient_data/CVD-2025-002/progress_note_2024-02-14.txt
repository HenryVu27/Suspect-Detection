Assessment/Plan:
1. Heart failure - appears stable. Continue current regimen. Reinforce daily weights
   and sodium restriction. Will check BNP.
2. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled on carvedilol. On Eliquis for anticoagulation.
   CHA2DS2-VASc = 5 (high stroke risk). Continue current therapy.
3. Type 2 diabetes - last A1c 7.6% (December). Continue metformin and Jardiance.
   Recheck A1c today.
4. Hypertension - not at goal (target <130/80 for HF/DM). Increase losartan to 100mg?
   Already at max. Consider adding thiazide but CKD limits options.
5. CKD stage 3 - stable. Continue to monitor. Avoid NSAIDs.
6. Health maintenance - due for mammogram, colonoscopy.

Labs ordered. RTC 3 months.
