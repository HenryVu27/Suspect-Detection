PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Gloria Washington    DOB: 08/22/1962    MRN: 23456789
Date: 2024-06-18       Provider: Dr. Marcus Williams, MD

Chief Complaint: F/U chronic conditions, fatigue

Subjective:
Pt returns for follow-up. Main complaint today is fatigue - "I'm tired all the time,
doc." Reports she's been dragging for past several months. Goes to bed early but
still feels exhausted. Daughter says she snores "like a freight train." Sometimes
wakes up with headaches.

HF symptoms stable - denies worsening SOB, no increase in edema. Sugars running
slightly higher per home log, 150-190 fasting. Has been under stress - son lost his
job, been helping with grandkids.

Admits she's been inconsistent with taking her afternoon carvedilol dose. "By evening
I just forget."

Review of Systems:
- Fatigue: severe, daily
- Sleep: poor quality despite adequate hours, snores, ? apneic episodes per family
- Mood: stressed but not depressed
- Weight: stable
- No fevers, chest pain, palpitations, leg pain

Objective:
Vitals: BP 148/90, HR 78 (irregular), RR 18, Temp 98.0F, Wt 202 lbs (+2), SpO2 93% RA
General: Tired-appearing obese female, NAD
HEENT: Oropharynx crowded, Mallampati class III
Neck: Thick, no LAD
CV: Irregularly irregular, no murmurs
Lungs: Clear
Ext: 1+ edema bilaterally

Labs from 6/10:
- A1c: 7.9% (up from 7.6)
- Cr: 1.8 (up from 1.6), eGFR 38
- K: 4.6
- BNP: 380

Assessment/Plan:
1. Fatigue - multifactorial. Likely contributors include uncontrolled DM, worsening
   renal function, possible OSA (snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime somnolence, AM
   headaches, crowded airway). ORDER SLEEP STUDY.
2. Possible obstructive sleep apnea - high clinical suspicion given above. Refer to
   sleep medicine after study completed.
3. Heart failure - stable clinically but BNP mildly elevated. Continue current
   regimen. Emphasize medication compliance.
4. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled. Continue Eliquis.
5. Type 2 diabetes - worsening control, A1c 7.9%. Increase Jardiance to 25mg daily.
   Reinforce diet and glucose monitoring.
6. CKD - concerning decline in eGFR from 42 to 38 over 4 months. Now stage 3b.
   Avoid nephrotoxins. Will refer nephrology if continues to decline.
7. Hypertension - still not at goal. Limited options given CKD and medication load.
   Continue current regimen.

Discussed importance of taking ALL medications as prescribed. Patient understands.

Sleep study scheduled. RTC 6-8 weeks.
