PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Gloria Washington    DOB: 08/22/1962    MRN: 23456789
Date: 2024-10-22       Provider: Dr. Marcus Williams, MD

Chief Complaint: Follow-up sleep study results, chronic disease management

Subjective:
Pt returns to review sleep study results and ongoing management. Sleep study completed
in August confirmed severe obstructive sleep apnea - AHI 42. She was fitted for CPAP
in September and has been using it "most nights." Reports she feels "a little better"
but still tired. "It takes some getting used to."

HF - stable. No worsening SOB. Occasional ankle swelling. Checking weights as
instructed - no sudden gains.

Diabetes - still running high. Fasting 160-180. Admits diet has been poor with
holidays coming up and family stress ongoing.

Reports she sometimes skips her medications when money is tight at end of month.
"The copays really add up." Has been rationing Eliquis - taking it once daily instead
of twice when running low.

This is extremely concerning - counseled extensively on stroke risk.

Objective:
Vitals: BP 144/88, HR 72 (irregular), RR 16, Temp 98.4F, Wt 198 lbs (-4 lbs), SpO2 94% RA
General: Obese female, appears less fatigued than last visit
CV: Irregularly irregular, rate controlled
Lungs: Clear
Ext: Trace edema

Labs from 10/15:
- A1c: 8.2% (worsening)
- Cr: 1.9, eGFR 35
- K: 5.1

Assessment/Plan:
1. Obstructive sleep apnea, severe (NEW DIAGNOSIS) - now on CPAP. Encourage nightly
   use. Download compliance data at next visit. May improve fatigue, BP, and glucose.
2. Heart failure - compensated. Continue current regimen.
3. Atrial fibrillation - CRITICAL ISSUE: Patient admits to taking Eliquis once daily
   instead of twice due to cost. This significantly increases stroke risk.
   INTERVENTION: Contacted patient assistance program. Applied for manufacturer copay
   card. Pharmacy to call with options. Emphasized MUST take BID as prescribed.
4. Type 2 diabetes - A1c 8.2%, worsening. Maximum on oral agents. Discussed adding
   basal insulin - patient resistant. Will try diet intervention first. Nutrition
   referral placed.
5. CKD stage 3b - eGFR 35, continuing slow decline. K slightly elevated at 5.1.
   Reduce dietary potassium. Nephrology referral placed.
6. Hypertension - still above goal. Limited by renal function and hyperkalemia risk.
7. Medication cost concerns - significant barrier to compliance. SW consult for
   assistance programs. Reviewed all medications for lower-cost alternatives.

RTC 6 weeks. Sooner if any concerns. Strict instructions to take Eliquis twice daily.
