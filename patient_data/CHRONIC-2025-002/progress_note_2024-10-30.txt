PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Jennifer Martinez    DOB: 05/18/1975    MRN: 45678912
Date: 2024-10-30       Provider: Dr. Amanda Lewis, MD

Chief Complaint: Fatigue, weight gain

Subjective:
Pt calls to be seen earlier than scheduled annual. Reports past 6-8 weeks feeling
very tired, "like I did before I was diagnosed with thyroid problems." Also noticed
weight gain of about 8 lbs despite no diet changes. Constipated for past month.
Hair seems thinner. Feels cold when others are comfortable.

Confirms she's been taking levothyroxine as prescribed. Takes it first thing in
morning with water, waits 30-60 min before eating or coffee. Recently started
taking calcium in the morning with her other vitamins - about 2 months ago.

No SOB, CP, palpitations. Mood okay but fatigue affecting her work.

Current Medications:
- Levothyroxine 75mcg daily
- Ferrous sulfate 325mg daily
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
- Calcium citrate 600mg BID (AM and PM)
- Multivitamin daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 124/78, HR 58, RR 14, Temp 97.8F, Wt 156 lbs (+8 lbs), BMI 26.0
General: Appears fatigued, dry skin
HEENT: Thyroid normal size, no nodules
CV: Bradycardia, regular
Skin: Dry, cool
Reflexes: Delayed relaxation phase

Labs ordered today (results pending):
- TSH, Free T4

Assessment/Plan:
1. Hypothyroidism - clinical symptoms suggest undertreatment. Likely cause: patient
   started taking calcium at same time as levothyroxine. Calcium interferes with
   thyroid hormone absorption! Counseled patient to separate calcium from
   levothyroxine by at least 4 hours. Will check TSH to confirm.
2. Weight gain - likely secondary to thyroid dysfunction.
3. Anemia - recheck when drawing thyroid labs.

Will call with lab results. Expect TSH to be elevated. May need dose adjustment
after confirming and allowing 4 weeks of proper medication timing.

ADDENDUM - 10/31/2024

Lab results reviewed:
- TSH: 12.8 mIU/L (HIGH - was 2.4 in April)
- Free T4: 0.6 ng/dL (LOW)
- Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL (stable)

As suspected, calcium interaction caused hypothyroid symptoms. Called patient.
Reinforced need to take calcium 4+ hours after levothyroxine. Will also increase
levothyroxine to 88mcg daily given degree of TSH elevation. Recheck in 6 weeks.
