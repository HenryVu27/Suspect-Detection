PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Patricia Williams    DOB: 08/22/1962    MRN: 34567891
Date: 2024-11-14       Provider: Dr. Michael Roberts, MD

Chief Complaint: DM follow-up, labs review

Subjective:
Pt here for routine follow-up. Reports glucose fairly well controlled - fasting 110-140
most days. Neuropathy symptoms stable. Daughter finished chemo and is doing well - pt
states mood is "much better" though still has bad days. Sleep still poor.

Notes she never completed the sleep study - "couldn't get time off work" (pt now works
part-time at library). Still snoring loudly per husband.

Reports occasional dizziness when standing quickly. Denies falls. No chest pain or SOB.
No vision changes. Due for eye exam.

Current Medications:
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Glipizide 10mg BID
- Jardiance 10mg daily
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80mg QHS
- Gabapentin 400mg TID
- ASA 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 134/82 sitting, 118/76 standing (orthostatic drop), HR 80, Wt 226 lbs (-4),
       BMI 37.5, SpO2 96% RA
General: Pleasant, less fatigued appearing than July
CV: RRR
Lungs: Clear
Ext: No edema, sensation impaired bilateral feet

Labs from 11/08:
- HbA1c: 7.3% (good improvement!)
- Fasting glucose: 128
- Cr: 1.4 (eGFR 45)
- K: 4.8
- Urine ACR: 95 mg/g

Assessment/Plan:
1. T2DM - well controlled! A1c 7.3%, excellent progress. Continue current regimen.
2. Diabetic nephropathy - eGFR 45, Stage 3b now. ACR 95. Continue SGLT2i and ACEi.
   Will refer to nephrology for co-management given progression.
3. HTN - better today. Orthostatic hypotension noted - likely medication related.
   Monitor symptoms. May need to reduce amlodipine if persists.
4. Neuropathy - stable.
5. OSA - still not evaluated. STRONGLY encouraged patient to complete sleep study.
   Rescheduled. Untreated OSA contributes to HTN, DM control, fatigue.
6. Depression - PHQ-9 today: 8 (mild). Improved with daughter's recovery. Will
   continue to monitor. Not restarting medication at this time per patient preference.
7. Obesity - trending down nicely. BMI 37.5, down from 38.9.
8. Overdue diabetic eye exam - ordered referral to ophthalmology.
9. Hyperlipidemia - LDL at goal on current statin dose.

Labs in 3 months. Nephrology referral placed. Sleep study scheduled.
