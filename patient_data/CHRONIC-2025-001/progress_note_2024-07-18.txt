PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Patricia Williams    DOB: 08/22/1962    MRN: 34567891
Date: 2024-07-18       Provider: Dr. Michael Roberts, MD

Chief Complaint: Follow-up diabetes, hypertension

Subjective:
Pt returns for DM follow-up. Reports feeling "a little better" on Jardiance - glucose
readings improved, fasting now 120-150. Still having nocturia but maybe slightly less.
Lost 4 lbs without really trying - attributes to Jardiance. Neuropathy symptoms unchanged.

Mood-wise, admits she's been struggling. Daughter going through chemo, she's been the
primary support. "I cry every day." Sleep poor - 4-5 hours. Low energy. Not enjoying
things she used to. Husband says she's been "withdrawn."

Reports loud snoring per husband. He says she "stops breathing" sometimes at night
then gasps. Wakes up with headaches most mornings. Falls asleep watching TV.

No chest pain or SOB. No vision changes.

Current Medications:
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Glipizide 10mg BID
- Jardiance 10mg daily
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80mg QHS
- Gabapentin 400mg TID
- ASA 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/86, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 98.2F, Wt 230 lbs (-4 lbs), BMI 38.2, SpO2 95% RA
General: Obese female, tired appearing, slow to respond
HEENT: Neck circumference appears large, MMM
CV: RRR
Lungs: CTA
Ext: No edema, sensation unchanged

Labs from 07/10:
- HbA1c: 7.6% (improved)
- Cr: 1.3 (eGFR 48)
- Urine ACR: 85 mg/g (elevated - moderately increased albuminuria)
- LDL: 95

Assessment/Plan:
1. T2DM - improved on Jardiance. A1c 7.6%. Continue current regimen.
2. Diabetic nephropathy - eGFR continues to decline (now 48), ACR elevated at 85.
   Already on ACEi and SGLT2i which is appropriate. Will continue to monitor.
3. HTN - improved but still above goal. Continue current meds.
4. Neuropathy - stable symptoms. Continue gabapentin.
5. Mood concerns - PHQ-9 today: 16 (moderately severe). Patient previously on
   sertraline and self-discontinued. Given current stressors and symptom severity,
   strongly recommend restarting antidepressant. Pt reluctant, wants to "see if
   things get better on their own." Discussed risks of untreated depression.
   Will revisit at next visit. Provided mental health resources.
6. Possible OSA - classic symptoms reported (snoring, witnessed apneas, morning HA,
   daytime somnolence). Would benefit from sleep study. Will order. High suspicion
   in obese patient with HTN.
7. Obesity - weight trending down slightly. Encouraged continued efforts.

RTC 3 months. Sleep study pending.
