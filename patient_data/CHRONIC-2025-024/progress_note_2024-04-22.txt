PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Frank Moretti    DOB: 06/14/1958    MRN: 90123789
Date: 2024-04-22       Provider: Dr. Sarah Goldman, MD (Gastroenterology)

Chief Complaint: Barrett's esophagus surveillance, GERD symptoms

Subjective:
65 yo M with Barrett's esophagus (diagnosed 2018, 4cm segment, no dysplasia) and
chronic GERD here for surveillance EGD scheduling and symptom check.

Reports increased heartburn over past 3 months. "The omeprazole doesn't work as
well as it used to." Heartburn 4-5 nights/week despite omeprazole 40mg daily.
Regurgitation 2-3x/week, especially after dinner or when bending over.

Diet: Admits to eating late at night. "I know I shouldn't but I get home late
from work." Still drinking 2-3 cups of coffee daily, occasional beer with dinner.
Spicy foods are a trigger.

Weight: Gained 10 lbs over past year. "Stress eating."

Dysphagia: Reports occasional food "sticking" in chest, especially with bread
and meat. "I have to drink water to wash it down." This is NEW symptom.

Odynophagia: Denies painful swallowing.

No hematemesis, melena, or unintentional weight loss.

Last EGD 2021 showed stable 4cm Barrett's without dysplasia.

Current Medications:
- Omeprazole 40mg daily (breakfast)
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Aspirin 81mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/86, HR 72, Wt 248 lbs (up 10 lbs), BMI 34.5
General: Obese male, appears well
Abdomen: Soft, obese, non-tender, no masses

Assessment/Plan:
1. Barrett's Esophagus - due for surveillance EGD per guidelines (last 2021).
   NEW CONCERNING SYMPTOM: Dysphagia to solids raises concern for stricture
   or progression to dysplasia/malignancy. EXPEDITE EGD.
   - Schedule EGD within 2 weeks (sooner than routine surveillance)
   - Will biopsy per Seattle protocol
   - If stricture found, may need dilation

2. GERD - poorly controlled on omeprazole 40mg daily. Contributing factors:
   obesity, late eating, coffee, hiatal hernia.
   - Increase to omeprazole 40mg BID
   - Lifestyle counseling: No eating 3 hours before bed, elevate head of bed,
     limit coffee, weight loss
   - If symptoms persist, may consider fundoplication referral

3. Obesity - BMI 34.5, contributing to GERD. Discussed weight loss urgently.
   Referred to weight management program.

4. Type 2 DM - check HbA1c today. Last was 7.4%.

5. HTN - BP 138/86, borderline. Continue lisinopril. Weight loss may help.

Patient understands importance of expedited EGD given new dysphagia. Will call
with scheduling.

RTC after EGD for results discussion.
