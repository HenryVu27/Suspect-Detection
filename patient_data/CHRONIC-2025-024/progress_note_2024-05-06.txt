PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Frank Moretti    DOB: 06/14/1958    MRN: 90123789
Date: 2024-05-06       Provider: Dr. Sarah Goldman, MD (Gastroenterology)

Chief Complaint: EGD results discussion

Subjective:
Pt returns for EGD results. Procedure performed 05/02/2024 under moderate sedation,
tolerated well. Some mild sore throat after, resolved.

Current symptoms: Heartburn slightly better on BID PPI. Dysphagia - still present
but maybe slightly less.

Objective:
EGD FINDINGS (05/02/2024):
- Esophagus: Barrett's segment now measuring 5-6cm (increased from 4cm in 2021)
  Salmon-colored mucosa with irregular nodularity in mid-segment (NEW)
  No stricture identified
  No ulceration
- Stomach: Mild gastritis
- Duodenum: Normal

BIOPSY RESULTS (returned 05/05/2024):
- Barrett's esophagus with LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LGD) - CONFIRMED by expert
  GI pathology review
- Multiple biopsies from nodular area show LGD
- No high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma

Assessment/Plan:
***SIGNIFICANT FINDING - BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS WITH LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA***

1. Barrett's with LGD - This represents PROGRESSION from prior non-dysplastic
   Barrett's. LGD has annual progression rate to high-grade dysplasia/cancer
   of 0.5-1% per year, but in the setting of visible nodularity this is higher
   concern.

   OPTIONS DISCUSSED:
   A) Endoscopic surveillance every 6 months (conservative)
   B) Endoscopic eradication therapy (radiofrequency ablation - RFA) - RECOMMENDED
      given visible nodularity and confirmed LGD

   DECISION: Patient elects RFA after detailed discussion of risks/benefits.
   - Refer to advanced endoscopy/Barrett's center for RFA evaluation
   - Continue high-dose PPI (essential for healing after ablation)

2. GERD - Maximum medical therapy essential. Continue omeprazole 40mg BID.
   Consider adding H2 blocker at bedtime if breakthrough symptoms.

3. Lifestyle modifications - CRITICAL. Explained that weight loss and dietary
   changes support Barrett's management. Reiterated counseling.

4. Dysphagia - No mechanical stricture. May be due to inflammation/Barrett's.
   Should improve after ablation treatment.

5. Cancer risk - Discussed that while LGD is concerning, treatment with RFA
   can prevent progression. Regular surveillance even after ablation is essential.

PATIENT EDUCATION:
- Explained Barrett's progression: non-dysplastic → LGD → HGD → cancer
- Discussed that RFA can eliminate dysplasia in >90% of cases
- Emphasized that even after successful ablation, lifelong surveillance needed
- Warning signs to report: Dysphagia worsening, weight loss, bleeding

Referral placed to University Barrett's Center. Will expedite.
