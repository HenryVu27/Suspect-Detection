ENDOSCOPY REPORT

Patient: Frank Moretti    DOB: 06/14/1958    MRN: 90123789
Procedure Date: 2024-05-02
Procedure: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy
Endoscopist: Dr. Sarah Goldman, MD
Anesthesia: Moderate sedation (fentanyl, midazolam)

================================================================================
INDICATION:
Barrett's esophagus surveillance, new-onset dysphagia, worsening GERD symptoms

================================================================================
PROCEDURE DETAILS:

Informed consent obtained. Patient NPO > 8 hours. Moderate sedation achieved.
Olympus GIF-H190 gastroscope advanced to second portion of duodenum.

FINDINGS:

ESOPHAGUS:
- Barrett's segment identified extending from 34cm to 39-40cm from incisors
  (approximately 5-6cm segment, Prague classification C4M6)
- INCREASED LENGTH compared to 2018/2021 (was 4cm, now 5-6cm)
- Salmon-colored, velvety mucosa consistent with intestinal metaplasia
- ***NODULAR AREA*** identified at 36cm on right lateral wall, approximately
  8mm, raised, slightly irregular surface (NEW FINDING)
- No ulceration
- No stricture (scope passed easily)
- GE junction at 40cm with small sliding hiatal hernia

STOMACH:
- Mild antral gastritis with patchy erythema
- No ulcers or masses
- Pylorus normal

DUODENUM:
- Normal first and second portions
- No masses or ulceration

================================================================================
BIOPSIES OBTAINED (Seattle Protocol plus targeted):

1. Nodular area 36cm - 4 quadrant biopsies of nodule (targeted)
2. 35cm - 4 quadrant biopsies
3. 36cm - 4 quadrant biopsies
4. 37cm - 4 quadrant biopsies
5. 38cm - 4 quadrant biopsies
6. Antral gastritis - 2 biopsies for H. pylori

Total: 22 biopsies

================================================================================
IMPRESSION:

1. BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS - INCREASED SEGMENT LENGTH (4cm to 5-6cm) with NEW
   NODULAR AREA requiring pathological evaluation. Concerning for dysplasia.

2. Small sliding hiatal hernia (stable)

3. Mild antral gastritis

4. No esophageal stricture to explain dysphagia (may be Barrett's-related)

================================================================================
PATHOLOGY RESULTS (Reported 05/05/2024):

SPECIMEN A (Nodular area 36cm):
- Barrett's esophagus with LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA
- Intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells
- Nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, and stratification consistent with LGD
- No high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma
- Diagnosis confirmed on expert GI pathology review

SPECIMENS B-E (Random quadrant biopsies):
- Barrett's esophagus with intestinal metaplasia
- Low-grade dysplasia also identified in specimen C (36cm)
- No high-grade dysplasia

SPECIMEN F (Antral biopsies):
- Mild chronic gastritis
- Negative for H. pylori
- Negative for intestinal metaplasia

================================================================================
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

1. BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS WITH LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LGD) - confirmed by expert
   pathology review
   - Progression from previously non-dysplastic Barrett's
   - Recommend endoscopic eradication therapy (RFA) given visible nodularity
     and confirmed dysplasia

2. Stable hiatal hernia

3. Mild chronic gastritis, H. pylori negative

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Continue high-dose PPI therapy
2. Refer to Barrett's Esophagus Center for radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
3. Repeat surveillance EGD in 6 months if RFA not performed
4. Weight loss, lifestyle modifications for GERD
