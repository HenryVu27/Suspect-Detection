PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Raymond Brooks    DOB: 03/08/1971    MRN: 23456789
Date: 2024-10-08       Provider: Dr. Angela Richardson, MD

Chief Complaint: OSA follow-up, BP check

Subjective:
53 yo M with newly diagnosed severe OSA returns for follow-up. Started CPAP in
April. Initial adjustment was rough - felt claustrophobic, mask leaks. DME adjusted
mask twice. Now using nasal pillows - "game changer."

CPAP use per download data: averaging 6.2 hours/night, AHI on CPAP 3.2 (controlled).

Reports feeling "like a new person." Energy improved significantly. Wife says
snoring resolved, no more apneas. Morning headaches gone. Can concentrate at work.
No more near-crashes while driving.

Lost 12 lbs over past 6 months - "Have energy to walk now, cut back on eating."

BP at home now running 125-135 systolic! Much better.

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Amlodipine 5mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 128/82, HR 72, Wt 254 lbs (-14), BMI 35.5, SpO2 97% RA
General: Alert, pleasant, appears more energetic than prior visits
HEENT: Crowded oropharynx unchanged but no longer as fatigued appearing
CV: RRR

Labs from 10/01:
- Fasting glucose: 98
- A1c: 5.6%
- Cr: 1.0, eGFR 85
- Lipids: TC 195, TG 165, HDL 42, LDL 120

Assessment/Plan:
1. Severe OSA - WELL CONTROLLED on CPAP! Excellent compliance. AHI reduced from
   38 to 3.2. Symptoms resolved. Continue current therapy.
2. Hypertension - NOW CONTROLLED! BP 128/82 today, at goal. OSA treatment has
   improved BP significantly. Consider reducing amlodipine if continues well
   controlled. Continue monitoring.
3. Obesity - weight trending down nicely. 14 lb loss. Encourage continued efforts.
   Improved energy from OSA treatment facilitating lifestyle changes.
4. Prediabetes - A1c 5.6% is at upper limit of normal. Weight loss should help.
   Continue monitoring annually.
5. GERD - reports reflux improved as well - OSA treatment and weight loss both help.
   Continue omeprazole for now.
6. Hyperlipidemia - LDL 120, slightly elevated. Given weight loss trajectory, will
   recheck in 6 months. Statin if not improving or if glucose worsens.

Excellent response to OSA treatment. CPAP is life-changing for this patient.
RTC 6 months or sooner if issues.
