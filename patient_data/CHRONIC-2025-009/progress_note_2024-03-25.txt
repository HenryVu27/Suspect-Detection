PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Raymond Brooks    DOB: 03/08/1971    MRN: 23456789
Date: 2024-03-25       Provider: Dr. Angela Richardson, MD

Chief Complaint: Sleep study results, OSA diagnosis

Subjective:
Pt returns for sleep study results. Symptoms unchanged - still exhausted, snoring.
Wife says apneas are very concerning - "he stops breathing for what feels like
30 seconds sometimes."

Switched from ibuprofen to acetaminophen per advice - headaches same frequency.

BP at home still 145-155 systolic.

HOME SLEEP TEST RESULTS (03/10/2024):
- AHI: 38 events/hour (SEVERE obstructive sleep apnea)
- Lowest SpO2: 78%
- Mean SpO2: 89%
- Time SpO2 <90%: 42 minutes
- Predominant obstructive events with some central components

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Amlodipine 5mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Acetaminophen PRN

Objective:
Vitals: BP 148/92, HR 80, Wt 266 lbs (-2), SpO2 96% RA
General: Obese, fatigued appearing, yawning

Assessment/Plan:
1. SEVERE Obstructive Sleep Apnea (AHI 38) - NEWLY DIAGNOSED
   - Referral to DME for CPAP setup
   - Discussed importance of treatment - CV risk reduction, BP improvement,
     symptom relief, safety (driving!)
   - Auto-titrating CPAP (APAP) ordered
   - Sleep hygiene reviewed, positional therapy if possible (side sleeping)
   - Weight loss will help but CPAP is primary treatment
2. Resistant hypertension - secondary to severe OSA. Expect improvement with CPAP.
   Will not add third agent yet. Recheck in 6-8 weeks after CPAP established.
3. Morning headaches - should resolve with CPAP treatment of nocturnal hypoxia.
4. Obesity - discussed. May have more energy to exercise once treating OSA.
5. Significant nocturnal hypoxia (SpO2 to 78%) - concerning. If CPAP not tolerated,
   may need supplemental O2.

DME appointment scheduled for CPAP. RTC 6 weeks.
