Chief Complaint: Fatigue, trouble concentrating

Subjective:
53 yo M here because he's "tired all the time." Reports feeling exhausted despite
getting "enough sleep" - in bed 8 hours but never feels rested. Wife complains he
snores "like a freight train" and sometimes seems to "choke or gasp" at night.

Falling asleep at his desk at work (accountant). Almost fell asleep driving last
week - had to pull over. Very concerning. Having trouble concentrating on spreadsheets.
Memory seems worse.

Headaches in morning more frequent - dull, goes away after being up for an hour.
Takes ibuprofen most mornings.

Blood pressure has been running high - home readings 145-155/90-95 despite medications.
"Not sure why it's not controlled - I take my pills."

Weight up about 15 lbs over past 2 years. Knows he needs to lose weight but too
tired to exercise.

Mood okay but frustrated with fatigue. Not depressed. No appetite changes.

- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Amlodipine 5mg daily
- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Ibuprofen PRN (using 3-4x/week for headaches)

Epworth Sleepiness Scale: 16/24 (excessive daytime sleepiness)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, witnessed apneas - HIGH SUSPICION
   for obstructive sleep apnea. Order home sleep study (HST). Classic presentation.
   Counseled on sleep hygiene while awaiting results. Avoid driving if drowsy.
2. Resistant hypertension - not controlled on 2 agents. OSA is likely contributing
   factor. Will hold adding third agent until sleep study results. If OSA confirmed
   and treated, may see BP improvement.
3. Obesity - contributes to OSA and HTN. Discussed weight loss but patient reports
   too fatigued. May improve once OSA treated.
4. Morning headaches - likely secondary to OSA (nocturnal hypoxia, hypercapnia).
   Should improve with CPAP if indicated.
5. NSAID use concerning given HTN - counsel to reduce ibuprofen use. May worsen
   BP control. Switch to acetaminophen.
6. GERD - continue omeprazole. GERD can be worse with OSA.

Home sleep test ordered. RTC 4 weeks for results review.
