PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Marcus Johnson    DOB: 09/10/1972    MRN: 56789345
Date: 2024-10-07       Provider: Dr. Robert Hayes, MD (Pain Management)

Chief Complaint: Chronic pain management follow-up, concerning symptoms

Subjective:
Pt returns for routine follow-up. Reports overall pain similar 6-7/10. However,
notes some new and concerning symptoms.

"My legs have been feeling weak lately. Sometimes they buckle when I'm walking."
States this started about 2 months ago and is getting worse. Also reports increased
numbness extending to both thighs now - "used to just be my feet."

New symptom: urinary hesitancy. "Takes a while to get started, and sometimes I
feel like I can't fully empty." Denies incontinence. Denies saddle numbness.
No fecal incontinence.

Also reports increased constipation despite MiraLAX - "haven't gone in 5 days."

Pain is more centralized in low back rather than radiating. "Different than usual."

Taking medications as prescribed. Working less due to difficulty sitting.

Mood remains low. PHQ-9 today: 16 (moderately severe, worse than before).
States he feels "hopeless" about pain ever improving.

Current Medications:
- Oxycodone ER 40mg BID
- Oxycodone IR 10mg Q6H PRN breakthrough
- Duloxetine 60mg daily
- Gabapentin 600mg TID
- Trazodone 100mg QHS
- Polyethylene glycol daily
- Docusate 100mg BID

Objective:
Vitals: BP 144/92, HR 82, Wt 242 lbs
General: Appears uncomfortable, fatigued
Lumbar spine: Diffuse tenderness, muscle spasm
Lower extremities:
  - Strength: Hip flexors 4/5 bilateral (stable), knee extension 4-/5 bilateral
    (WORSE), ankle dorsiflexion 4/5 bilateral (WORSE)
  - Reflexes: Absent at ankles and knees (was 1+ at ankles before)
  - Sensation: Diminished to light touch bilateral thighs, legs, feet (EXPANDED)
Gait: Wide-based, unsteady, nearly fell during exam
Rectal exam: Decreased sphincter tone (NEW)

PDMP: Consistent. UDS: Positive oxycodone only.

Assessment/Plan:
1. ***RED FLAG SYMPTOMS*** - NEW progressive bilateral leg weakness, expanded
   sensory loss, urinary symptoms, decreased rectal tone. CONCERN FOR CAUDA EQUINA
   SYNDROME vs progressive neurological compromise.
   - URGENT MRI lumbar spine with and without contrast ordered TODAY
   - Called radiology - will perform this afternoon
   - If MRI shows compression, will need emergent surgical referral
   - Discussed with patient - must go to ER if develops urinary retention,
     fecal incontinence, or saddle anesthesia before MRI

2. Chronic Low Back Pain - concerning for new pathology. Hold any interventions
   pending MRI.

3. Chronic Opioid Therapy - continue current regimen. This is NOT opioid-induced
   hyperalgesia - there is objective neurological decline.

4. Depression - worsening PHQ-9 16. Increase duloxetine to 90mg. Consider
   psychiatry referral.

5. Constipation - could be medication-related but concerning given bowel symptoms.
   Add lactulose, may need disimpaction.

CALLED PATIENT AT HOME 6:30 PM - MRI shows severe central canal stenosis L3-L4
with cauda equina compression. Spoke with spine surgery on call. Patient instructed
to go to ER for admission. Will likely need urgent decompression surgery.
