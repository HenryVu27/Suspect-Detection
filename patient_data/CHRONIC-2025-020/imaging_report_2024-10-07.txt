IMAGING REPORT - MRI LUMBAR SPINE

Patient: Marcus Johnson    DOB: 09/10/1972    MRN: 56789345
Exam Date: 2024-10-07 16:45
Ordering Provider: Dr. Robert Hayes, MD
Reading Radiologist: Dr. Amanda Foster, MD

================================================================================
EXAMINATION: MRI Lumbar Spine without and with contrast

CLINICAL INDICATION: Progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness, expanded
sensory loss, urinary hesitancy, decreased rectal tone. Concern for cauda equina
syndrome. URGENT.

COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine 2019-08-12

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the lumbar spine performed without
and with IV gadolinium contrast on 3T scanner.

================================================================================
FINDINGS:

VERTEBRAL BODIES:
- L3: Mild degenerative changes, no acute fracture
- L4: Moderate degenerative changes, mild retrolisthesis on L5
- L5: Moderate degenerative changes
- S1: Normal
- Marrow signal normal throughout, no evidence of metastatic disease

INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS:
- L2-L3: Mild disc bulge, no significant stenosis
- L3-L4: ***LARGE CENTRAL DISC EXTRUSION with inferior migration, measuring
  approximately 15mm craniocaudal x 12mm transverse. SEVERELY COMPRESSES
  CAUDA EQUINA with obliteration of CSF signal. NEW since 2019.***
- L4-L5: Post-laminectomy changes. Moderate disc bulge with annular tear.
  Moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
- L5-S1: Moderate disc bulge, moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis. Stable.

SPINAL CANAL:
- L3-L4: ***SEVERE CENTRAL CANAL STENOSIS secondary to disc extrusion described
  above. AP diameter reduced to approximately 5mm (normal >12mm). CAUDA EQUINA
  COMPRESSION CONFIRMED.***
- L4-L5: Moderate stenosis, post-surgical changes
- L5-S1: Moderate stenosis

NEURAL FORAMINA:
- L4-L5: Moderate bilateral narrowing
- L5-S1: Moderate bilateral narrowing

CONUS MEDULLARIS: Normal position and signal, terminates at L1.

CAUDA EQUINA: ***COMPRESSED AND DISPLACED POSTERIORLY at L3-L4 level by central
disc extrusion. Nerve roots crowded and clumped. Concerning for cauda equina
syndrome.***

PARASPINAL SOFT TISSUES: Post-surgical changes. No collection or abscess.

POST-CONTRAST: No abnormal enhancement to suggest infection or tumor.

================================================================================
IMPRESSION:

1. ***LARGE CENTRAL DISC EXTRUSION AT L3-L4 WITH SEVERE CENTRAL CANAL STENOSIS
   AND CAUDA EQUINA COMPRESSION. NEW SINCE 2019. FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH
   CLINICAL CONCERN FOR CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME.***

2. Known post-laminectomy changes L4-L5 with moderate residual stenosis.

3. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
