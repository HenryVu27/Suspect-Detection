ADDITIONAL CONCERNS (In your own words)

"My life revolves around pain management. Every decision I make - what I eat,
when I sleep, whether I go out - is based on my pain levels. I used to be
active, played basketball, hiked. Now I can barely walk to the mailbox.

The surgery in 2017 was supposed to fix things but made them worse in some ways.
I have 'failed back surgery syndrome' - what a name. Makes me feel like a failure.

I know the doctors worry about the opioids but they're the only thing that
lets me function at all. Without them I'd be bedridden. I'm not an addict -
I take them exactly as prescribed. I just wish people understood that chronic
pain is real and disabling.

The depression makes everything harder. It's hard to stay positive when you're
in pain 24/7. I lost my marriage, my career, my social life. I'm 51 and feel
like 81.

One thing I've noticed lately - my legs feel weaker than usual. Sometimes they
almost give out. My feet are more numb too. Probably just getting older but
maybe worth mentioning."
