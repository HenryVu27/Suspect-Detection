PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Walter Thompson    DOB: 08/25/1955    MRN: 78901567
Date: 2024-09-09       Provider: Dr. James Morrison, MD (Movement Disorders)

Chief Complaint: Parkinson's disease follow-up, new symptoms

Subjective:
Pt returns for follow-up. Now retired as of June - "Best decision I made."
Wife Diane accompanies again.

Motor symptoms: Stalevo helped with wearing-off initially but last 2-3 months
having new issues:
- Dyskinesias - "Writhing movements" in arms and legs, especially afternoon
- "On-off" fluctuations - unpredictable periods of immobility
- More freezing when trying to start walking or going through doorways
- Two falls last month - "My feet just stopped and I kept going forward"
  (No injuries, fell onto soft surface)

Wife adds: "The movements are sometimes so bad he can't hold a fork. Then an
hour later he's frozen and can barely move. It's like a rollercoaster."

Non-motor symptoms:
- NEW: Visual hallucinations - "Sees people who aren't there. Usually at night.
  He knows they're not real but it's disturbing." Started about 6 weeks ago.
  Per patient: "I see a man standing in the corner. I know he's not there but
  he looks real."
- Sleep: RBD symptoms returning despite clonazepam - wife sleeping in guest room
  after he hit her during a dream last month
- Mood: More anxious during off periods. "I panic when I can't move."
- Cognition: Wife notes more forgetfulness, repeating stories

Swallowing: Some coughing with liquids. "Drinks go down wrong way sometimes."

Current Medications:
- Stalevo 25/100/200 QID
- Pramipexole 0.5mg TID
- Clonazepam 0.5mg QHS
- Midodrine 5mg TID
- Sertraline 50mg daily
- Polyethylene glycol daily
- Docusate 100mg BID

Objective:
Vitals: BP 144/86 sitting, 112/68 standing, HR 68
General: Currently in "on" state with moderate dyskinesias
Neuro:
  - Mentation: Alert, oriented, but slower to respond. MoCA 23/30 (was 27)
  - Speech: Hypophonic, some slurring
  - Dyskinesias: Moderate choreiform movements bilateral arms and trunk
  - Tremor: Present but less prominent (masked by dyskinesias)
  - Rigidity: Moderate when not dyskinetic
  - Bradykinesia: Moderate
  - Gait: Festinating, required 2 attempts to initiate walking, freezing at
          doorway during exam
  - Postural stability: Retropulsion 3 steps, caught by examiner

Observed "off" period during visit - pt became rigid, unable to rise from
chair without assistance for approximately 20 minutes until next dose took
effect.

UPDRS Motor Score: 34 in off state (significant worsening)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Parkinson's Disease - ADVANCING TO STAGE 3 (Hoehn & Yahr). Motor fluctuations
   and dyskinesias now significantly impacting function. UPDRS worsened 20->34.
   - This is classic levodopa long-term complication pattern
   - Medication restructuring:
     * Reduce individual Stalevo doses but increase frequency (smaller more frequent)
     * Consider extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (Rytary) for smoother coverage
     * May need to reduce or stop pramipexole (contributing to dyskinesias)
   - DBS evaluation: Patient now a candidate. Refer to neurosurgery for DBS
     evaluation. Discussed risks/benefits.

2. Visual hallucinations - NEW AND CONCERNING. Likely PD-related psychosis.
   - Rule out: Infection (check UA, CBC), metabolic (check CMP)
   - Reduce pramipexole (dopamine agonists major contributor) - taper from
     0.5mg TID to 0.25mg TID
   - If persists, may need pimavanserin (Nuplazid) - approved for PD psychosis
   - AVOID typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, etc.) - contraindicated

3. Falls - high risk. PT referral for gait training, home safety evaluation.
   Consider rollator walker. Fall precautions education.

4. Dysphagia - coughing with liquids concerning for aspiration risk.
   - URGENT: Speech therapy referral for swallow evaluation
   - May need modified barium swallow study
   - Aspiration precautions: Chin tuck, thickened liquids if indicated

5. Cognitive decline - MoCA dropped from 27 to 23. Concerning for PD dementia.
   Monitor closely. May need formal neuropsych testing.

6. RBD worsening - increase clonazepam to 0.75mg QHS. Consider melatonin add-on.
   Bed safety measures (floor mattress, padded rails).

7. Depression/anxiety - worse during off states. Continue sertraline. Consider
   increasing if needed.

Complex patient with advancing PD. Multiple new issues requiring multidisciplinary
approach. Will see in 6 weeks after medication changes. DBS eval in process.
