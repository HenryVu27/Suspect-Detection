Patient: Walter Thompson    DOB: 08/25/1955    MRN: 78901567

Chief Complaint: Parkinson's disease follow-up

Subjective:
68 yo M with Parkinson's disease (Dx 2018, tremor-predominant) here for routine
follow-up. Wife Diane accompanies.

Motor symptoms: Tremor controlled most of the day on current regimen. Notes some
"wearing off" - tremor returns about 30 minutes before next dose. Morning stiffness
takes about an hour to resolve after first dose.

Bradykinesia: "I'm slower than I used to be." Handwriting smaller. Wife notes he
takes longer to dress in the morning.

Gait: Some hesitation starting to walk. No freezing episodes. Using no assistive
device. No falls.

Non-motor symptoms:
- Sleep: RBD well-controlled on clonazepam. "Haven't acted out dreams in months."
- Constipation: Chronic, using MiraLAX and Colace daily. BM every 2-3 days.
- Mood: "Some days harder than others." Continuing sertraline.
- Cognition: Wife reports some forgetfulness but nothing concerning. "He still
  beats me at Scrabble."

Orthostatic symptoms: Lightheaded when standing quickly. Midodrine helps. Has
learned to stand slowly.

Still working part-time as consultant engineer. Plans to retire end of this year.

Current Medications:
- Carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 QID (6am, 11am, 4pm, 9pm)
- Pramipexole 0.5mg TID
- Clonazepam 0.5mg QHS
- Midodrine 5mg TID (not after 6pm)
- Sertraline 50mg daily
- Polyethylene glycol daily
- Docusate 100mg BID

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/82 sitting, 118/70 standing (orthostatic positive), HR 72
General: Pleasant, cooperative, appropriate affect
Neuro:
  - Mentation: Alert, appropriate, MoCA 27/30
  - Speech: Mildly hypophonic
  - Face: Mild masked facies, reduced blink rate
  - Tremor: Mild resting tremor right hand (4-5 Hz), less prominent left
  - Rigidity: Mild cogwheel rigidity bilateral upper extremities
  - Bradykinesia: Moderate - finger tapping slowed, micrographia present
  - Gait: Mildly reduced arm swing right > left, slight stooped posture,
          no freezing, turn normal
  - Postural stability: Retropulsion 1 step, self-corrects

UPDRS Motor Score: 24 (was 20 six months ago - mild progression)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Parkinson's Disease - mild progression. UPDRS 24, up from 20. Wearing-off
   phenomenon developing. Options discussed:
   - Add COMT inhibitor (entacapone) to extend levodopa effect
   - Increase levodopa dose
   - Decision: Start Stalevo (carbidopa-levodopa-entacapone) 25/100/200 QID
     to replace current carbidopa-levodopa
   - Discussed long-term - DBS may be option in future if motor fluctuations
     become more problematic

2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - controlled on clonazepam. Continue.

3. Orthostatic hypotension - symptomatic but manageable. Continue midodrine.
   Reviewed hydration, compression stockings, slow position changes.

4. Depression - stable on sertraline. PHQ-9 today: 6 (mild). Continue.

5. Constipation - chronic, managed with current regimen. Continue.

6. Cognition - MoCA 27/30, stable from last year. Monitor.

RTC 4 months. Sooner if wearing-off not improved on new regimen.
