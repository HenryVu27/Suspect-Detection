PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Jessica Romano    DOB: 04/22/1985    MRN: 78912567

Chief Complaint: Routine mental health follow-up

Subjective:
38 yo F here for routine follow-up. Continues to do well. Mood stable - "the best
I've felt in years." Working out regularly, sleeping well, enjoying social activities.

Work promoted to senior project manager - happy but also slightly anxious about
new responsibilities. "Good anxiety - motivating."

Mother finished chemo and is in remission - huge relief.

Started dating someone new - feeling optimistic.

Therapy tapered to every 2 weeks - feels adequate.

Occasionally misses a dose of buspirone when traveling - considering whether she
still needs it.

No depressive symptoms. No SI.

Current Medications:
- Sertraline 150mg daily
- Buspirone 10mg TID (sometimes misses doses)
- Trazodone 100mg QHS (sometimes skips if sleepy)

Objective:
Vitals: BP 114/68, HR 68, Wt 130 lbs
General: Pleasant, animated, well-groomed
Psych: Mood "great", affect full and appropriate

PHQ-9: 2 (minimal depression)
GAD-7: 5 (mild anxiety)

Assessment/Plan:
1. MDD in sustained remission - PHQ-9 = 2. Continue sertraline 150mg indefinitely.
   Discussed importance of maintenance therapy given multiple recurrences.
2. GAD - well controlled. Patient asks about tapering buspirone. Given current
   stressors (new role) and history, recommend continuing for now. Can revisit
   in 6 months if continues doing well. If wants to try tapering, do slowly.
3. Insomnia - resolved. Can use trazodone PRN at this point.
4. Overall wellness - excellent. Lifestyle factors (exercise, therapy, social
   support) contributing to stability.

Continue current meds. Reduce trazodone to PRN. RTC 3-4 months.
