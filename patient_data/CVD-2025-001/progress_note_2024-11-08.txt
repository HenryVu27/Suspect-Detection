PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Robert Thompson    DOB: 03/14/1958    MRN: 12345678

Chief Complaint: Follow-up after cardiology evaluation

Subjective:
Pt here for follow-up after seeing cardiology in August. Reports he was started on new
medications by Dr. Torres including carvedilol and spironolactone. Furosemide was
increased. States SOB has improved "maybe 50%" - can now do stairs without stopping but
still gets winded. Edema much better. Denies CP. Reports he has been "trying harder"
with diet - less fast food, watching salt. Still not exercising regularly.

Also mentions he's been feeling "down" and "not like himself" for several months now.
Trouble concentrating at work. Sleep still poor. "I just don't have energy for anything."

Current Medications per pt (needs reconciliation):
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS
- ASA 81mg daily
- Clopidogrel 75mg daily
- Carvedilol 12.5mg BID (new per cardiology)
- Spironolactone 25mg daily (new per cardiology)
- Furosemide 40mg daily (increased per cardiology)
- Amlodipine 5mg daily

Objective:
Vitals: BP 132/82, HR 68, RR 16, Temp 98.0F, Wt 240 lbs (-8 lbs from July), SpO2 97% RA
General: Appears tired but less fatigued than July visit
CV: RRR, rate controlled, S1 S2 present, no S3 today, no murmurs
Lungs: Clear bilaterally, no crackles
Ext: Trace edema bilateral ankles, improved
Affect: Flat, makes poor eye contact

Labs from 10/25:
- Cr: 1.4, eGFR 52 (declining)
- K: 4.9 (on spironolactone, will need to monitor)
- A1c: 7.8%
- BNP: 520 (still elevated but pt clinically improved)

Cardiology note reviewed - Echo showed EF 40%, diagnosis of HFrEF.

Assessment/Plan:
1. Heart failure (HFrEF) - newly diagnosed per cardiology. Clinically improving on GDMT.
   Will continue carvedilol, spironolactone, furosemide as prescribed. Patient counseled
   on daily weights, sodium restriction, fluid limitation.
2. Hypertension - MUCH better controlled today on current regimen! Continue.
3. Type 2 diabetes - A1c 7.8%, worsening. Increase metformin to 1000mg BID if tolerating.
   Consider adding SGLT2 inhibitor which would also benefit HF.
4. Renal function declining - eGFR now 52, down from 72 one year ago. Likely combination
   of diabetic nephropathy and cardiorenal syndrome. Defer nephrology referral for now
   given recent HF diagnosis - reassess in 3 months.
5. CAD - stable, no angina. Continue DAPT.
6. Hyperlipidemia - defer statin intensification given multiple medication changes.
7. Mood/possible depression - significant symptoms reported. PHQ-9 today: 14 (moderate).
   Discussed options including counseling vs medication. Pt reluctant to add another pill.
   Will consider at next visit. Provided crisis line number just in case.

RTC 6-8 weeks. Sooner if SOB worsens, weight gain >3lbs/day or 5lbs/week.
