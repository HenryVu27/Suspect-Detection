CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION

Patient: Robert Thompson    DOB: 03/14/1958    MRN: 12345678
Date of Service: 2024-08-20
Referring Provider: Dr. Sarah Chen, MD (Primary Care)
Consulting Provider: Dr. Michael Torres, MD, FACC

================================================================================
REASON FOR CONSULTATION
================================================================================
Progressive dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, elevated BNP. History of
CAD s/p PCI. Evaluate for heart failure.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
================================================================================
Mr. Thompson is a 66-year-old gentleman with history of CAD status post LAD stent
placement in 2022, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity who
presents for evaluation of progressive exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema
over the past 2-3 months.

Patient reports he first noticed getting "winded" going up stairs about 2-3 months
ago. This has progressively worsened - he now gets short of breath walking one block
on flat ground. He has to stop and rest frequently. He also noticed bilateral ankle
swelling that worsens throughout the day and improves overnight.

He reports orthopnea - needs 2 pillows to sleep comfortably. No paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea. No chest pain or palpitations. He has gained approximately 8-10 pounds over
the past 2 months. Notes increased fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance.

Denies fevers, chills, cough, or recent illness.

Remote smoking history - quit 15 years ago. Previously smoked 1 PPD x 20 years.

================================================================================
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
================================================================================
Vitals: BP 142/88, HR 84 (regular), RR 20, SpO2 95% on room air, Weight 252 lbs

General: Alert, obese male, appears mildly short of breath at rest
HEENT: No JVD at 30 degrees; at 45 degrees, JVP elevated to approximately 12 cm
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 present, S3 gallop appreciated,
         no murmurs or rubs, PMI laterally displaced
Lungs: Bibasilar crackles extending 1/3 up, no wheezes
Abdomen: Obese, soft, non-tender, no hepatomegaly appreciated
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema to mid-calf bilaterally, warm, pulses 2+
Neurologic: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits

================================================================================
DIAGNOSTICS
================================================================================
ECG (today):
- Normal sinus rhythm at 82 bpm
- Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria
- Non-specific ST-T wave changes in lateral leads
- No acute ischemic changes
- Q waves in V1-V2 (old, unchanged from prior)

Labs (from referring physician):
- BNP: 340 pg/mL (elevated)
- Cr: 1.3 (baseline 1.1)
- eGFR: 58

ECHOCARDIOGRAM (performed today):
- Left ventricular ejection fraction: 40% (reduced; prior echo 2022 showed EF 55%)
- Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy
- Global hypokinesis with regional wall motion abnormality in LAD territory
- Left atrial enlargement (mild)
- Grade II diastolic dysfunction
- Mild mitral regurgitation
- Estimated PASP: 38 mmHg (mildly elevated)
- No pericardial effusion
- Patent LAD stent by color flow

================================================================================
IMPRESSION
================================================================================
1. NEW DIAGNOSIS: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
   - EF 40%, down from 55% in 2022
   - Likely mixed etiology: ischemic cardiomyopathy from CAD plus hypertensive
     heart disease
   - NYHA Class II-III symptoms
   - ACC/AHA Stage C heart failure

2. Coronary artery disease, status post PCI
   - Stent appears patent on echo
   - However, given new HFrEF, will need stress testing to evaluate for
     progressive ischemia vs new lesions

3. Uncontrolled hypertension
   - Contributing to LV remodeling and HF
   - BP 142/88 today despite 2 agents

4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus - additional risk factor for cardiomyopathy

5. Obesity - contributing to symptoms and cardiac risk

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
1. INITIATE GUIDELINE-DIRECTED MEDICAL THERAPY (GDMT) FOR HFrEF:
   a. Start Carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily, titrate to target dose as tolerated
      (will replace need for amlodipine for BP)
   b. Start Spironolactone 25 mg daily (check potassium and creatinine in 1 week)
   c. Increase Furosemide to 40 mg daily for volume management
   d. Continue Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor is part of GDMT)

2. STOP Amlodipine - beta blocker will provide better mortality benefit

3. Consider adding SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin) - benefits
   for HFrEF independent of diabetes. Coordinate with PCP for diabetes management.

4. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS:
   - Strict sodium restriction <2 grams daily
   - Fluid restriction 1.5-2 liters daily
   - Daily weight monitoring - call if gain >3 lbs in one day or >5 lbs in one week
   - Smoking cessation if not already achieved (confirmed quit 15 years ago)
   - Cardiac rehabilitation referral

5. ORDER: Nuclear stress test (pharmacologic given deconditioning) to evaluate
   for progressive CAD. If positive, will need cardiac catheterization.

6. DEVICE EVALUATION: If EF remains <=35% on repeat echo after 3 months of GDMT,
   patient may be candidate for ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

7. FOLLOW-UP:
   - Return to cardiology in 4 weeks for medication titration
   - Repeat echocardiogram in 3 months
   - Labs (BMP, BNP) in 1 week to check potassium/creatinine on new medications

8. COMMUNICATION: Discussed diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan with patient
   at length. He understands heart failure is a serious chronic condition that will
   require lifelong management and medication compliance. He expressed concern given
   his father's cardiac history. I reassured him that with modern treatment, outcomes
   have improved significantly. He is motivated to make lifestyle changes. Wife was
   present and will help with diet modifications and medication reminders.

   Patient was given my office number and instructions to call or go to ED if
   experiencing worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or rapid weight gain.
