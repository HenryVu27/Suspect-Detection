Labs from 7/15 reviewed:

- Fasting glucose: 148
- Cr: 1.3 (up from 1.1), eGFR 58
- LDL: 122
- BNP: 340 (new, elevated)

Assessment/Plan:
1. New dyspnea on exertion with LE edema - concerning for possible early heart failure
   given risk factors and elevated BNP. Order echo, refer to cardiology for evaluation.
2. Hypertension - poorly controlled. BP consistently >140/90. Add amlodipine 5mg daily.
3. Type 2 diabetes - A1c 7.6%, not at goal. Increase metformin if tolerated.
4. Hyperlipidemia - LDL still above goal. Will defer statin change pending cardiology input.
5. Worsening renal function - Cr trending up, eGFR 58. Monitor closely. May need to
   adjust meds. Consider nephrology if continues to decline.
6. Weight gain - 6 lbs since March. Contributing to above issues. Strong counseling on
   diet and exercise.
7. Mood symptoms - reports feeling down, stressed. Screen PHQ-9 at next visit.

Urgent cardiology referral placed. RTC 2 weeks for BP check, sooner if worsening symptoms.
