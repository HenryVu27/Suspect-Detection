PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Sandra Mitchell    DOB: 09/30/1960    MRN: 67891456
Date: 2024-10-28       Provider: Dr. James Wilson, MD

Chief Complaint: HTN/CKD follow-up

Subjective:
64 yo F returns for chronic disease follow-up. Reports BP much better at home since
starting spironolactone and consolidating evening meds - now running 135-145/80-88.
Using pill organizer - "game changer for remembering my meds."

Saw nutritionist - working on reducing sodium, bringing lunch from home instead of
eating cafeteria food. Lost 5 lbs.

No headaches, chest pain, SOB, swelling. Energy good.

Planning to retire next year - looking forward to less stress.

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 40mg daily (AM)
- Amlodipine 10mg QHS
- Chlorthalidone 25mg daily (AM)
- Metoprolol succinate 100mg QHS
- Spironolactone 25mg daily (AM)
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS

Objective:
Vitals: BP 138/82, HR 64, RR 14, Wt 193 lbs (-5), BMI 32.6
General: Well-appearing, less anxious
CV: RRR, S4 present
Lungs: Clear
Ext: No edema

Labs from 10/21:
- Cr: 1.45 (stable), eGFR 42
- K: 5.0 (on spironolactone - monitor)
- Urine ACR: 85 mg/g (improved from 120!)
- Aldosterone/Renin ratio: 12 (normal - no primary aldo)

Assessment/Plan:
1. Resistant Hypertension - NOW CONTROLLED! BP 138/82 today, home readings confirm.
   Spironolactone addition was key. No primary aldosteronism per labs - just
   resistant HTN responding to MRA. Continue current regimen.
   Monitor K on spironolactone.
2. CKD Stage 3b - eGFR 42, STABLE. Proteinuria improved (ACR 85, was 120)! BP control
   is slowing progression. Excellent response.
3. LVH - will need repeat echo in 1-2 years to assess for regression with BP control.
4. Obesity - making progress! 5 lb weight loss. Encourage continued efforts.
5. Hyperlipidemia - controlled.

Continue current regimen. This is an excellent response to intensified management.
RTC 4 months. Recheck K in 2 weeks (on spironolactone + ACEi).
