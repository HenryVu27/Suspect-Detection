PROGRESS NOTE
Patient: Sandra Mitchell    DOB: 09/30/1960    MRN: 67891456
Date: 2024-04-08       Provider: Dr. James Wilson, MD

Chief Complaint: Hypertension follow-up, CKD management

Subjective:
63 yo F with longstanding resistant HTN and CKD Stage 3a here for follow-up.
BP at home still running high - 155-165/90-100. Admits medication adherence
"could be better" - sometimes misses evening dose because she forgets.

Denies headaches, visual changes, chest pain, SOB. No swelling. Urination normal.

Works as middle school teacher - stressful job. Reports high salt intake due to
eating cafeteria food. "Hard to eat healthy at school."

No new symptoms. Concerned about kidney function.

Current Medications:
- Lisinopril 40mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Chlorthalidone 25mg daily
- Metoprolol succinate 100mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg QHS

Objective:
Vitals: BP 162/98, HR 68, RR 16, Wt 198 lbs (stable), BMI 33.5
General: Well-appearing, anxious about BP reading
CV: RRR, S4 present (LVH)
Lungs: Clear
Ext: No edema

Labs from 04/01:
- Cr: 1.4 (was 1.2 last year), eGFR 44 (declining from 52)
- K: 4.6
- Urine ACR: 120 mg/g (new - moderately increased)
- Lipids at goal

Assessment/Plan:
1. Resistant Hypertension - on 4 agents but still above goal. Contributing factors:
   - Medication non-adherence (evening doses missed)
   - High salt intake
   - Obesity
   - Consider secondary causes if persists

   Plan:
   - Consolidate dosing: switch to evening amlodipine, all PM meds together
   - Pill organizer counseling
   - Dietary counseling - reduce sodium
   - If still uncontrolled, consider aldosterone/renin ratio for primary aldosteronism
   - Add spironolactone 25mg for resistant HTN (also protects kidney)

2. CKD Stage 3b - eGFR has declined from 52 to 44 in one year. This is faster than
   expected. Proteinuria now present (ACR 120). Hypertensive nephrosclerosis
   progressing. MUST control BP to slow progression.
3. LVH - consequence of chronic HTN. BP control critical.
4. Obesity - discussed weight loss. Patient interested but needs support.
   Refer to nutritionist.
5. Hyperlipidemia - at goal on statin.

Labs: aldosterone/renin ratio if BP still uncontrolled in 8 weeks
Nutrition referral placed
RTC 8 weeks
